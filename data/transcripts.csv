0,canplanetearthfeedtenbillionpeoplepart1.wav," All parents remember the moment when they first held their children, the tiny crumpled face, an entire new person emerging from the hospital blanket. I extended my hands and took my daughter in my arms. I was so overwhelmed that I could hardly think. Afterward I wandered outside so that mother and child could rest. It was three in the morning late February in New England. There was ice on the sidewalk and a cold drizzle in the air. As I stepped from the curb a thought popped into my head. When my daughter is my age, almost ten billion people will be walking the earth. I stopped mid-stried. I thought, how is that going to work? In 1970 when I was in high school, about one out of every four people was hungry, under nourished to use the term preferred today by the United Nations. Today the proportion has fallen to roughly one out of ten. In those four plus decades the global average lifespan has astoundingly risen by more than eleven years. Most of the increase occurred in poor places. Hundreds of millions of people in Asia, Latin America and Africa have lifted themselves from destitution into something like the middle class. This enrichment has not occurred evenly or equitably. Millions upon millions are not prosperous. Still, nothing like this surge of well-being has ever happened before. No one knows whether the rise can continue or whether our current affluence can be sustained. Today the world has about 7.6 billion inhabitants. Demographers believe that by about two thousand fifty that number will reach ten billion or a bit less. Around this time our population will probably begin to level off. As a species we will be at about replacement level. On average each couple will have just enough children to replace themselves. All the while economists say the world's development should continue, however unevenly. The implication is that when my daughter is my age a sizeable percentage of the world's ten billion people will be middle class. Like other parents I want my children to be comfortable in their adult lives. But in the hospital parking lot this suddenly seemed unlikely. Ten billion mouths I thought. Three billion more middle class appetites how can they possibly be satisfied? But that is only one part of the question. The full question is how can we provide for everyone without making the planet uninhabitable? Biter rivals. While my children were growing up I took advantage of journalistic assignments to speak about these questions from time to time with experts in Europe, Asia and the Americas. As the conversations accumulated the responses seemed to fall into two broad categories, each associated at least in my mind, with one of two people, both of the Americans who lived in the 20th century. The two people were barely acquainted and had little regard for each other's work, but they were largely responsible for the creation of the basic intellectual blueprints that institutions around the world use today for understanding our environmental dilemmas. Unfortunately, their blueprints offer radically different answers to the question of survival. The two people were William Vote and Norman Borlog. Vote, born in 1902, laid out the basic ideas for the modern environmental movement. In particular, he founded what the Hampshire College Population Researcher Betsy Hartman has called apocalyptic environmentalism. The belief that, unless humankind drastically reduces consumption and limits population, it will ravage global ecosystems. In bestselling books and powerful speeches, Vote argued that affluence is not our greatest achievement, but our biggest problem. If we continue taking more than the Earth can give, he said, the unavoidable result will be devastation on a global scale. Cut back, cut back was his mantra. Borlog, born twelve years after Vote, has become the emblem of techno-optimism. The view that science and technology, properly applied, will let us produce a way out of our predicament. He was the best known figure in the research that, in the 1960s, created the Green Revolution, the combination of high yielding crop varieties and agronomic techniques that increased grain harvest around the world, helping to avert tens of millions of deaths from hunger. To Borlog, affluence was not the problem, but the solution. Only by getting richer and more knowledgeable can humankind create the science that will resolve our environmental dilemmas. Innovate, innovate, was his cry. Both men thought of themselves as using new scientific knowledge to face a planetary crisis, but that is where the similarity ends. For Borlog, human ingenuity was the solution to our problems. One example, by using the advanced methods of the Green Revolution to increase per acre yields he argued, farmers would not have to plant as many acres. An idea researchers now call the Borlog hypothesis. Vote's views were the opposite. The solution, he said, was to use ecological knowledge to get smaller. Rather than grow more grain to produce more meat, humankind should, as his followers say, eat lower on the food chain, to lighten the burden on Earth's ecosystems. This is where Vote differed from his predecessor, Robert Malthus, who famously predicted that societies would inevitably run out of food because they would always have too many children. Vote, shifting the argument, said that we may be able to grow enough food, but at the cost of wrecking the world's ecosystems. I think of the adherence of these two perspectives as wizards and prophets. Vote's following Borlog's model unveiled technological fixes. Profits looking to vote decry the consequences of our heedlessness. Borlog and Vote traveled in the same orbit for decades, but rarely acknowledged each other. Their first and only meeting in the mid-1940s led to disagreement. Immediately afterward, Vote tried to get Borlog's work shut down. So far as I know, they never spoke afterward. Vote referred to the others' ideas in public addresses, but never attached a name. Instead, Vote rebuked the anonymous deluded scientists who were actually aggravating our problems. Borlog branded his opponents, Luddites. Both men are dead now, but the dispute between their disciples has only become more vehement. Wizards view the prophets' emphasis on cutting back as intellectually dishonest, indifferent to the poor, even racist, because most of the world's hungry are non-caucasian. Following Vote, they say, is a path toward regression, narrowness, poverty, and hunger, toward a world where billions live in misery despite the scientific knowledge that could free them. Profits sneer that the wizard's faith in human resourcefulness is unthinking, ignorant, even driven by greed, because refusing to push beyond ecological limits will cut into corporate profits. Eye-intensity Borlog-style industrial farming, profits say, may pay off in the short run, but in the long run will make the day of ecological reckoning hit harder. The ruination of soil and water by heedless overuse will lead to environmental collapse, which will in turn create worldwide social convulsion. The research reply, that's exactly the global humanitarian crisis we are preventing. As the finger pointing has escalated, conversations about the environments have turned into dueling monologues each side unwilling to engage with the other, which might be all right if we weren't discussing the fate of our children. The Roads to Hell Vote entered history in 1948 when he published Road to Survival, the first modern we're all going to hell book. It contained the foundational argument of today's environmental movement, carrying capacity. Often called by other names, ecological limits, planetary boundaries, carrying capacity posits that every ecosystem has a limit to what it can produce. That limit for too long and the ecosystem will be ruined. As human numbers increase, Road to Survival said, our demands for food will exceed the Earth's carrying capacity. The results will be catastrophic, erosion, desertification, soil exhaustion, species extinction, and water contamination that will sooner or later lead to massive famines. Most by writers like Rachel Carson, the author of Silent Spring and one of Votes Friends, and Paul Ehrlich, the author of the Population Bomb, votes arguments about exceeding limits became the wellspring of today's globe-spanning environmental movement, the only enduring ideology to emerge from the past century. When Road to Survival appeared, Borlough was a young plant pathologist working in a faltering program to improve Mexican agriculture. Sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, the project focused on helping the nation's poor corn farmers. Borlough was in Mexico for a small side project that involved wheat, or rather black stem rust, a fungus that is wheat's oldest and worst predator. The Romans made sacrifices to propitiate the god of stem rust. Old usually killed stem rust in the United States, but it was constantly present in warmer Mexico, and every spring winds drove it across the border to reinfect U.S. wheat fields. The sole Rockefeller researcher working on wheat, Borlough was given so little money that he had to sleep in sheds and fields for months on end. But he succeeded by the mid-50s in breeding wheat that was resistant to many strains of rust. Not only that, he then created wheat that was much shorter than usual, what became known as semi-dwarf wheat. In the past, when wheat was heavily fertilized, it had grown so fast that its stalks became spindly and fell over in the wind. The plants unable to pull themselves erect had rotted and died. Borlough's shorter stouter wheat could absorb large doses of fertilizer and channel the extra growth into grain rather than roots or stalk. In early tests, farmers sometimes harvested literally ten times as much grain from their fields. Yeels climbed at such a rate that in 1968 a USAID official called the Rise the Green Revolution, thus naming the phenomenon that would come to define the 20th century. The Green Revolution had its most dramatic effects in Asia, where in 1962 the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation opened the International Rice Research Institute, Eri, in the Philippines. At the time at least half of Asia lived in hunger and want. Farm yields in many places were stagnant or falling. Governments that had only recently thrown off colonialism were battling communist insurgencies, most notably in Vietnam. US leaders believed the appeal of communism lay in its promise of a better future. Washington wanted to demonstrate that development occurred best under capitalism. Eri's hope was that top research teams would transform Asia by rapidly introducing modern rice agriculture, a Manhattan project for food, in the historian Nick Colathor's phrase. Following Borlough's lead, Eri researchers developed new high yielding rice varieties. These swept through Asia in the 70s and 80s, nearly tripling rice harvests. More than 80% of the rice grown in Asia today originated at Eri. Even though the continent's population has soared, Asian men, women, and children consume an average of 30% more calories than they did when Eri was founded. Soul and Shanghai, Jipur and Jakarta. Learning skyscrapers, pricey hotels, traffic jammed streets ablaze with neon. All were built atop a foundation of laboratory bread rice. With profits disproved, was carrying capacity a chimera? No. As vote had predicted, the enormous jump in productivity led to enormous environmental damage, drained aquifers, fertilizer runoff, aquatic dead zones, and degraded and waterlogged soils. Worse in a human sense, the rapid increase in productivity made rural land more valuable. Suddenly, it was worth stealing, and rural elites in many places did just that, throwing poor farmers off their land. The profits argued that the green revolution would merely postpone the hunger crisis. It was a one-time lucky break, rather than a permanent solution. And our rising numbers and wealth mean that, just as the profits said, our harvests will have to jump again. A second green revolution, the Wizards' ad. Even though the global population in 2050 will be just 25% higher than it is now, typical projections claim that farmers will have to boost food output by 50 to 100%. The main reason is that increased affluence has always multiplied the demand for animal products such as cheese, dairy, fish, and especially meat. And growing feed for animals requires much more land, water, and energy than producing food simply by growing and eating plants. Exactly how much more meat tomorrow's billions will want to consume is unpredictable, but if they are anywhere near as carnivorous as today's westerners, the task will be huge. And profits warn. So will the planetary disasters that will come of trying to satisfy the world's desire for burgers and bacon. Ravage landscapes, struggles over water, and land grabs that leave millions of farmers in poor countries with no means of survival. What to do? Some of the strategies that were available during the first green revolution aren't anymore. Farmers can't plant much more land because almost every accessible acre of arable soil is already in use. Nor can the use of fertilizer be increased. It is already being overused everywhere except some parts of Africa, and the runoff is polluting rivers, lakes, and oceans. Irrigation too cannot be greatly expanded. Most land that can be irrigated already is. Wizards think the best course is to use genetic modification to create more productive crops. Profits see that as a route to further overwhelming the planet's carrying capacity. We must go in the opposite direction, they say. Use less land, waste less water, stop pouring chemicals into both. It is as if humankind were packed into a bus racing through an impenetrable fog. Somewhere ahead is a cliff, a calamitous reversal of humanity's fortunes. Nobody can see exactly where it is, but everyone knows that at some point the bus will have to turn. Problem is, wizards and profits disagree about which way to yank the wheel. Each is certain that following the others' ideas will send the bus over the cliff. As they squabble, the number of passengers keeps rising."
1,cocoonoflove.wav," When the war began, I was four years old. What war? We all have our wars. Mine was World War II, you can tell from age. I was born to a happy Jewish family and a very bad place to be born at that time, and at a wrong time. That was Southeast Poland. In July 1941, the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union, ran over the town where we were. In that first week, there were many losses. My grandfather was killed. The Ukrainians in town rounded up the people, drove them up to the castle where SS Einsatzgruppe Sey killed 2,000 people. Things did not get better. We stayed in a town a little while, and then later went to a labor camp called Latskir. This was essentially slave labor to fix blown up bridges and roads. My father was a civil engineer, and he had built those roads. He had some privileges in the labor camp where we all were. He could pass in and out, and the only documents we have from the war, in fact, are some passes, which say the Jew, Hilal, Safran, can pass out of this camp. We were in this camp. Sometimes it was good. Sometimes it was bad. Here is a story that my mother tells one day, two German officers came into the camp and perhaps looking for some to scare us. They said to my mother, tell the boy to sit on the dog house. There was a dog house. One of them said, I'm going to shoot the dog. The other one said, what if the clowns are misses? They all left. I went and sat on the dog house. One of them pulls out his gun, takes one shot in the air. The dog runs out, shoots the dog with a second shot, just centimeters away from where I was. The situation got very bad in time. People were being sent to the extermination camps. No one wanted to believe it, but my father and mother believed it. They found someone to hide us. They found a friendly Ukrainian schoolteacher in a nearby village who offered to hide us. One dark night we walked out of the camp. You could bribe the guards. This was not an extermination camp. We walked to that schoolhouse and went into the attic. We did not leave that schoolhouse for 15 months. That was January 43. In the attic, this was a one-room schoolhouse. The village had maybe 200 souls, maybe 30 kids were there. The front room was a one-room schoolhouse and a back-to-teacher lived above was the attic. That's where we were. Food was brought up once a day in a pale. Slops were taken away. There was one window. There were slats in the window. We put a cloth over it at night. We rarely lit a light. I sat by that window. In the attic, I slept on a straw mattress. There was a bag of peas as a pillow. I looked out that window. I could see children playing outside. It was a schoolhouse after all. I could hear them during recess running, but I knew I couldn't be with them. Among those children were actually a few Jewish boys who were kept at the orphanage at the monastery, at the end of the road in this little village of Oniv. They were kept under false identities. The monks saved them. The Ukrainian Greek Catholic monks. One of those boys I finally found and we established. We had been in the same town. 60 years later, later became a foreign minister of Poland, Adam Daniel Rothfeld. I played games. My mother taught me how to read. She invented all these games. There were geography books there. This was a schoolhouse. There was stored up there. She taught me latitude and longitude. We played these games where she would say, she would give me a latitude and longitude. I would have to say whether it was wet or dry. The final skill thing was she would try to find a lake in the middle, like the Great Lakes of the Aral Sea. I would fall down. She asked me, how do you go from here to there? How do you go from Onya of the village where we were to Montevideo or to California? I would have to name every sea along the way. Some of those passes around Denmark have pretty hairy names for a little boy. I would do that. I would play endlessly and I had to keep quiet. In there were actually four people initially, an Anko and Ant, my mother and I. My father would join us later. Anko and Ant had a two-year-old. I was five years old, almost five years, a four and a half, when we went into the attic. The Anko and Ant had a two-year-old at the time. It was judged that I would keep quiet, but the two-year-old would not be able to keep quiet and the attic. She was given to a Polish family to keep and neither the Polish family nor the little girl survived the war. I would play these endless games. Once in a while, in the beginning of our stay, my father would come to visit. One time he brought some candy. I can't imagine now what it must have cost to find some candy in that time of war, but he found it. One day he did not come and the letter was slipped under our door, saying that his attempt to break out of the camp, had another Anko and a partisan group in a forest. They were smuggling weapons into the camp. My father remained in a camp as the head of an attempt to break out. One, his attempt was betrayed, and the letter said that he was tortured and shot in town. My mother cried. She tried not to cry when I was there, of course. And to hold some of her feelings in, I only learned later, she wrote some of her thoughts in a little notebook which had actually belonged to my father, and in which he kept notes in the labor camp on a book on relativity theory that he was reading. The book was in German. His notes were in German. And in that book, she wrote later her feelings, which was one of the few places she had to write. Eventually, it got too cold up in the attic. The attic was open to the outside. There were holes in it, and we couldn't survive another Ukrainian winter. And we moved down to a storeroom on a first floor, a room about maybe eight by ten feet. And there we were, by now we were five. My uncle had come in from the forest. And in that room, we lifted up some floorboards. We dug out some of the earth to build a bunker, a hiding place, because occasionally police came to the schoolhouse, and we dug out this place, so we could go in there and hide in the worst times. And then the floorboards would move over, and a cupboard moved over that. I still remember the smell of the wet earth, it's something you don't forget. We stayed in there, and all this time I felt enveloped by a, what I would call a cocoon of love. There was this tremendous love around me, even as there was this danger, terrible danger out there. Eventually the Russians came back, driving Studebaker trucks, and we could hear the artillery in a distance, the offensive at Stolt, not too far from the town, and from where we were. And one day it was also a night in June 44. This is a long time before the war ended in Europe, but this is when we were freed by the Red Army. We walked out from that schoolhouse, and walked across muddy clay fields, and after rain, and my mother carried me. I was seven at this point. The two women supported the men. The men's legs were swollen from lack of motion. We walked across the German lines where a soldier gave us a ride and a truck into town, and I could see some of the German bodies lying in a road. We were refugees in Europe then for a while. We left Poland, my mother remarried after the war, and I then had a sister. Born already in this country, we came to this country. We lived happily ever after. I went to PS16 Brooklyn and to Stuyveson High School, the same school that Eric went to, and just seven blocks from here. And we were happy. We kept all the time in touch with the family who had saved us, of the men. Eventually the past away we keep in touch with the children to this day in the next generation. In 2006, five years ago, my sister and I, and my son, Hillel, who was named as my father was Hillel, went back to that village and to the town. And the schoolhouse was still there, and the attic was still there. The schoolhouse was expanded and rebuilt, but the attic was still there. And we climbed into the attic, and it was very important that my son be there, because at the point that we climbed into that attic five years ago, he had a five-year-old, my grandson Sam. And so, as I watched my son, as we touched hands, I could feel that he knew what it meant to be a five-year-old, shut in the attic. We climbed down and wanted to see the place where the storeroom was, but the school had been rebuilt. The storeroom had been rebuilt into a classroom. That's what Igor Duke, the son of the people, had saved us, said. And I look at this classroom, and on the wall is Mendelay's periodic table of the elements. Now, I'm a chemist. I became a chemist almost by accident. I'm a good chemist. It took my mother 25 years to get over the fact that I didn't become a real doctor. And I look around this room, and there's some chemical equipment, and there is some more stuff in the walls about acids and bases, and the same room in which we had been hidden 62 years before that. It was now a chemistry classroom. Now, there were in a town altogether 4,000 Jews, 4,000 Poles, 4,000 Ukrainians. Of the 4,000 Jews, maybe 200 survived the war. And the 4 children among them, those children are all in the United States. We had done well, but what about those hundreds and hundreds of children who had not survived, who did not, or even have the cocoon of love, who told them together whose deaths were solitary, who will tell their stories, who will speak for the dead."
2,exorcism.wav," So, I'm not depressed now, but I was depressed for a long time, and I wrote about being depressed, and I lived for a long time with blinding depression and had long stretches when everything seemed hopeless and pointless when returning calls from friends seemed like more than I could do when getting up and going out into the world seemed painful when I was completely crippled with anxiety. And when I finally got better and started writing about the process of recovery, I became very interested in all of the different kinds of treatment that there were for depression. And having started as a kind of medical conservative, thinking that there were only a couple of things that worked, medication, and certain talking therapies, and that that was really it, I very gradually began to change my mind, because I realized that if you have brain cancer and you decide that standing on your head and gargling for half an hour every day makes you feel better, it may make you feel better, but the likelihood is that you still have brain cancer and you're still going to die from it. But if you have depression and you say that standing on your head and gargling for half an hour makes you feel better, then you are actually cured because depression is an illness of how you feel, and if you feel really great after you do that, then you're not depressed anymore. So I began to think all kinds of things could work, and I researched everything ranging from experimental brain surgeries to hypnotic regimens of various kinds. I had people writing to me because I had been publishing on this subject, there was one woman who wrote to me and she said that she had tried actually electro shock treatments and a variety of other approaches to depression, medication, and therapy, and she had finally found the thing that worked for her and she wanted me to tell the world about it, and that was making little things from yarn. Some of which she sent me. And none of which I'm wearing right now, but in any event, I had that rich engagement. And I also became interested, as I was doing this work, in the idea that depression existed not only in the civilized West as people tended to perceive it to exist, but actually across cultures and had existed across time. And so when one of my dearest friends, my friend David Hecht, who was living for a little while in Senegal, said to me, do you know about the tribal rituals that are used for the treatment of depression here? I said, no, I don't know about them, but I would like to know about them. And he said, well, if you come for a visit, we could try to do some research on this topic. And so I sat off for Senegal, and I met David, and I was introduced to David's then-girl friend now ex-wife, Ellen. And it turned out that Ellen had a cousin whose mother was a friend of someone who went to school with the daughter of a person who actually practiced the undock, and that I could therefore go and interview this woman who had practiced the undock. And so we went off to a small town about two hours outside of the car, and I was introduced to this extraordinary, old, large woman wrapped in miles and miles of African fabric printed with figures of eyes. And she was Madame D'Euf, and we did an interview for about an hour, and she told me all about the undock. And at the end of it, feeling rather daring, I said, listen, I said, I hope, I don't know whether this is something you would even consider, I said, but would it be possible for me to attend an undock? And she said, well, I've certainly never had a foreigner, the local word was too bomb. I've never had a foreigner attend one of these before. She said, but actually she said, I mean, you've come through these friends and these connections. She said, yes, the next time I perform an undock, you may be present. And I said, that's fantastic. I said, when are you next going to be doing an undock? And she said, oh, it'll be sometime in the next six months. And I said, six months is quite a long time for me to stay here in this town waiting for you to do one. I said, is there anyone who might maybe could expedite one for somebody? Move it forward. I'll pitch in. She said, no, it really doesn't work that way. She said, I'm sorry, but that's how it is. And I said, well, I guess I won't be able to see an undock then, but even so, this conversation has been so interesting and so helpful to me. And I'm a little sad leaving here about not actually getting to see one, but I thank you. And she said, well, I'm glad that you could come. I'm glad it was helpful. And she said, but there is one other thing. She said, I hope you don't mind my saying this. And I said, well, no, what? What is it? And she said, you don't look that great yourself. She said, are you you are suffering from depression? And I said, well, yes, I said I was very acute. It's kind of a little better now, but I still do actually suffer from depression. She said, well, I've certainly never done this for a two-bob before, but I could actually do an undock for you. And I said, oh, I said, what an interesting idea. I said, well, yes, sure. Yeah, absolutely. Yes, let's let's let's do that. I said, that I'll have an undock. And she said, well, that's great. She said, and she gave us some some sort of fairly basic instructions. And then we left. And my translator, the aforementioned then girlfriend now ex-wife of my friend turned to me and she said, are you completely crazy? Do you have any idea what you're getting yourself into? And I said, well, you know, I'm an all-time all these things very interesting. She said, you're crazy. She said, you're totally crazy, but I'll help you if you want. So we had left. And the first thing we had was a shopping list. There had been a she had you could get them to buy the stuff, but you had to be a surcharge. I said, no, we'd buy the stuff. So we had to go out. We had to buy seven yards of African fabric. We had to get a calabash, which was a large bowl fashion from a gourd. We had to get three kilos of millet. We had to get sugar. We had to get colabines. And then we had to get two live cocktails, two roosters and a ram. And so Ellen and I went to the market with David and with these other people. And we got most of the things. And I said, well, but what about the ram? And Ellen said, we can't buy the ram today. What are we going to do with it overnight? So I saw the sense of that. So the next day. The next day we got into a taxi to go back out two hours to where we were going. And I said, what about the ram? And Ellen said, oh, we'll see a ram along the way. So we were going along and going along. And there was a Senegalese shepherd by the side of the road with his flock. And we stopped the cab and we got out. And we bought the ram for $7. And then we had a little bit of a struggle getting the live ram into the trunk of the taxi cab. But the cab driver seemed not at all worried, even by the fact that the ram kept relieving himself in the trunk of the taxi cab. And so then we got to Rufis and we got there. So here I am. I'm ready for my close up. And the thing about the end up is that it varies enormously depending on a whole variety of signals and symbols that come from above. So we had to go through this whole shamanistic process. And I still didn't know really very much of what was going to happen. So first I had to change out of my jeans, my t-shirt and put on a loin cloth. And then I sat down and then I had my chest and my arms rubbed with millet. And then which is a grain. And then someone said, oh, we really should have music for this. And I said, oh great. And I thought, you know, drumming. I thought some atmospheric thing. And she came out with her very prized possession, which was a battery operated tape player for which she had one tape, which was chariots of fire. So we started listening to chariots of fire. And in the meanwhile, I was given sort of various shamanistic objects. I had to hold them with my hands and drop them. I had to hold them with my feet and drop them. They would sort of say, oh, this auger's well, this auger's badly. There were five assistants to Madame Dioff who had all gathered around. And we said, we spent the morning like this. And it was all really just fine. And then they said it was maybe we started at about eight, maybe about 11, 11, 30. They said, well, now it's actually time for the central part of the ritual. And I said, oh, okay. And this sound of drumming, the drumming I've been hoping for, the drumming began. And so there was all of this drumming. And it was very exciting. And we went to the central square of the village where there was a small makeshift. Wedding bed that I had to get into with the ram. And I had been told it would be very, very bad luck if the ram escaped. And that I had to hold on to him. And that the reason we had to be in this wedding bed was that all my depression and all my problems were caused by the fact that I had spirits in Senegal. You have spirits that have all over you the way here. You sort of have microbes. Some are good for you. Some are bad for you. Some are neutral. Anyway, my bad spirits were extremely jealous of my real life. Sexual partners. Some of them were here tonight. And that we had to modify the anger of the spirits. So I had to get into this wedding bed with the ram. And I had to hold the ram very tightly because he was not having a good life this ram. And he, of course, immediately relieved himself on my leg. And the entire village had taken the day off from their work in the fields. And we're dancing around us in concentric circles. And as they danced throwing blankets and sheets of cloth over us. And so we were gradually being buried. And it was unbelievably hot. And it was completely stifling. And there was the sound of these stamping feet as everyone danced around us. And then these drums, which were getting louder and louder and more ecstatic and more ecstatic. And I was just about at the point in which I thought I was going to faint or pass out at that key moment. Suddenly all of the claws were pulled off. I was yanked to my feet. The loincloth that was all I was wearing was pulled from me. The poor old ram's throat was slipped as were the throats of the two cock rolls. And I was covered in the blood of the freshly slaughtered ram and the cock rolls. And so there I was, naked, totally covered in blood. And they said, OK, that's the end of this part of it. And I said, OK, hey. And they said, but you, they said, we're actually, we, the next piece comes now. And I said, OK, we went over back to the area where we'd done the morning preparations. And one of them said, but look, it's kind of lunchtime. Why don't we just take a break for a minute? Would you like a Coke? I don't drink Coke that much. But at that moment, it seemed like a really, really, really good idea. And I said, yes. And so I sat there naked and completely covered in animal blood with flies kind of gathering as they will when you're naked and covered in animal blood. And I drank this coke. And then when I had finished the coke, they said, OK, now we have the city final parts of the ritual. They said, so first you have to switch your hands by your sides and hold your stand very straight and very erect. And I said, OK. And then they tied me up with the intestines of the ram. And in the meanwhile, it was hanging from a nearby tree. And they were, there was someone said, if doing some butchering of it. And they took various little bits of it out. And then I had to kind of shuffle over all tied up in intestines, which most of you probably haven't done, but it's hard. I had to shuffle over and I had to take these little pieces of the ram and I had to dig holes and I had to put the pieces of the ram in the holes. And I had to say something. And what I had to say was actually, to me, incredibly, strangely touching in the middle of this weird experience. I had to say spirits, leave me alone to complete the business of my life and know that I will never forget you. And I thought, what a kind thing to say to the evil spirits you're exercising that I'll never forget you and I haven't. So anyway, there were various other little bits and pieces that followed. I was given a piece of paper in which all of the millet from the morning had been gathered. I was told that the next morning I should sleep with it under my pillow and in the morning get up and give it to a beggar who had good hearing and no deformities. And that when I gave it to him, that would be the end of my troubles. And then the women sort of all filled their mouths with water and began spitting water all over me, which it turns out is the sort of, you know, it's the surround shower effect and rinsing the blood away from me. And it gradually came off. And when I was clean, they gave me back my jeans and everyone danced and they barbecued the ram and we had this dinner and I felt so up. I felt so up. It had been quite an astonishing experience, even though I didn't believe in the animus principles behind it. All of these people had been gathered together cheering for me. And it was very exhilarating. And I had a very odd experience five years later when I was working on my current book and I was in Rwanda doing something else altogether. And I got into a conversation with someone there. And I described the experience I'd had in Senegal. And he said, oh, you know, we have something that's a little like that. He said, that's West Africa. This is East Africa. It's quite different. But there are some similarities in some rituals here. He said, you know, we had a lot of trouble with Western mental health workers who came here immediately after the genocide. And we had to ask some of them to leave. And I said, what, what was the problem? And he said, okay, they came and their practice did not involve being outside in the sun like what you're describing, which is after all where you begin to feel better. There was no music or drumming to get your blood flowing again when you're depressed and you're low and you need to have your blood flowing. He said, there was no sense that everyone had taken the day off so that the entire community could come together to try to lift you up and bring you back to joy. He said, there was no acknowledgement the depression has something invasive and external that could actually be cast out of you again. He said, instead, they would dig people one at a time into these dingy little rooms and have them sit around for an hour or so and talk about bad things that had happened to them. He said, we had to get them to leave the country. Thank you."
3,backsideofthestorm.wav," I'm a climber, which is fairly remarkable, given the fact that when I first climbed, I was petrified of heights. Every time I went out, I'd say to myself, if I ever get out of here alive, I will never do this again. But when you're 16 years old and you get back down to the ground, the exhilaration overwhelms the terror. And every time I went out, the terror was a little less, the exhilaration was a little more, and I loved it. I loved it. And I started climbing at all my free time on weekends. Weekends became weeks, weeks became months. I was a dirt-bag climber. When I was 19 years old, I triggered an avalanche high up in a gully, a long narrow ice gully, and I was nearly swept hundreds of feet down, probably to my death. I knew 5% of what I needed to know to be in that place, and by luck, just by luck, that 5% is what I needed to survive. I spent a lot of time after that learning about the science of snow. A few years later, I was offered a job teaching climbing in Northern New England. Well, I didn't know if I could share my passion with my profession, but I would get paid to go climbing, and that's not so bad. So I moved to North Conway, where there was a small group of hardcore climbers, climbers just like me. We worked together, we climbed together, we trained together, we lived together, we did everything together. We were a community, we were a family, that ability to be on the rock, where nothing existed in the universe, except what I could touch with my hands or my feet, to push myself to my complete limit, and then when necessary to push a little further. There was a young climber part of our community. He was local, his name was Albert. We were on the cliff together one day on different climbs with clients, and his client was having trouble standing up on his feet. He was leaning into the rock, that's not good when you're rock climbing, especially hundreds of feet up. And he looked down at him, and he said, stand up, stand up like a man. I grew up in a house in New Hampshire, his kitchen floor was steeper than this. That was the type of intensity in drive we all had, part of my community, part of my family. I was asked to be in an elite new mountain rescue team, elite because when you're high up in the mountains at two in the morning, and it's 20 below, and the wind's blowing at 70, you need to know that the person on your shoulder is solid, and they need to know that you're solid. Winter in the mountains is where I like to spend a lot of my time guiding clients up Mount Washington. In one weekend there was a Norrester coming in. I could see it on the maps, it was a big one. But I knew it wasn't going to hit to a little later in the afternoon. And I said to my clients, we will not be able to summit today, but if you want, we can get up to tree line, we can feel the oncoming storm. They were game. When we got two thirds of the way up the mountain and got above the scrub pines and onto the exposed rock, we were feeling the oncoming force of the storm. Blowing 50, 55, it was probably about 10 degrees, the wind was like hands on me moving me around trying to push me out of balance. The cold was trying to find any gap in my face mask or goggles to try to freeze a little bit to flesh. I had pushed as far as I was comfortable with. I didn't have to say anything. I simply pointed down and we headed down the mountain. And soon we were down on the shelter of the trees. When we were there, in the face mask came down and the goggles went up, everybody's eyes were the size of silver dollars. I took my clients back to town and then headed home. The storm was really beginning to break at this point. It was really beginning to rage. I got home, I had my plate of pasta and my two glasses of cheap red wine. And I went to bed. But in the middle of the night the phone was ringing. There were two climbers missing on Mount Washington. The team assembled the next morning. But the norrester was passing us. We were on the back side of it. And the back side of it means that the counterclockwise flow is now pulling cold Arctic air down on us. The winds were accelerating. The temperatures were plummeting. We searched. But the winds were blowing 70, 80. It was 20 below zero. And the wind wasn't just moving me around. It was knocking me down. The cold wasn't looking for little bits of flesh. It wanted my hands and my feet and I couldn't feel them. We searched all day and we never found a sign of the two young climbers from Pennsylvania who would come up on their own to do a climb on Mount Washington. The next morning we gathered again and headed up in the Huntington Revee and we broke up in the teams of two to climb all of the gullies to see if we could find any sign of the two young climbers. Albert and his partner Michael radioed that they were going to go across a plateau and down a different trail. Well, the rest of us worked our ways back down to the bottom of the ravine. We hadn't found any sign of the climbers. That was it. We were done for the day. We got in the snowcat, which is a giant tracked vehicle. It could hold our entire team, a dozen of us. And we're going to pick up Albert and Michael. I felt a sense of relief. We were done for the day. I had been beaten up, knocked down and cold for two days. But I was going home and the rest of the team was healthy. And then the radio came alive. Avalanche, avalanche. Michael was screaming avalanche. The world sort of turns really quickly. All of a sudden the snowcat accelerates down and over and up into the talkroom in the ravine. When we got to the trailhead, two of our team jumped off into a first aid cache to get avalanche probes, long aluminum tubes, ten feet long, that you pushed down into the snow looking for missing people. We got up to the avalanche debris. And as we looked around, as I looked up, I could see a hand poking through. Michael had poked a hole through the snow to create a breathing hole. Two of our team went up to dig him out. The rest of us stood shoulder to shoulder. We took our probes. We pushed them down into the snow as far as we could. I pushed down, lifted up, then in unison we stepped forward. I pushed down, I hit something hard. I didn't know. Was it Albert? Was it just a block of ice? I had to know because every second counts and it broke through the ice. To my left, one of the team-mails I've got him. I dropped my probe, I headed over, I grabbed a shovel, I got in line. When it was my turn, I dug with as much strength and as much speed as I could. 20, 30 seconds, then it just fell to the side. Somebody took my place. I got my breath, I got back in line. It was my turn again. I dug as hard and as fast as I could. There he was, three or four feet down. There was Albert's head. We started to dig around him. But he wasn't breathing. We cleared snow around him and carefully moved him up onto the snow. But he still wasn't breathing. We tried to get a breath in to start CPR, but the breath wouldn't go in. And I saw the gash under his chin. It snapped his neck. The wind was still howling, the snow was swirling. I was standing there with 12 of the toughest people I have ever known in my entire life in everyone's crying. We gently took his body and put it into a litter, strapped him down and carried him down to the snowcath. As we went down the mountain, I sat there in the open back, just looking at the lifeless body of my friend. When he got to the bottom, there were reporters. So I bolted to my car. I had to tell his girlfriend before she heard anything. I was almost at her house when I saw another car pull her over. I got out as I walked forward. Another friend was telling her what had happened. And I stood there in front of her and she was screaming. I didn't have any words. I was numb. I was just crying. The next day, two young climbers were found on the other side of the mountain. They had severe hypothermia. They were close to death. They had massive amounts of frostbite. They were going to lose limbs. I didn't care. My friend was dead. In these two idiots had caused it. A lot of bourbon was consumed. A lot of crying. But life went on. I kept climbing. I kept guiding. Every year, I'd head up to the side of the avalanche just to be there, just to look and think about my missing friend. I had nightmares almost every night. I'd wake up in the middle of the night, sweating, seeing the body of my friend in the snow. And then a friend of mine, Marie, told me that she had talked to one of the climbers. One of the idiots would cause my friend's death. And he was moving to town. He wanted to live in my valley. So he'd be accessible for people to talk to, to confront. He had been faceless to me. He had just been the object of my hatred. And now he was going to be there. One day, I was walking down the street. And across the street, at a coffee shop called the Muffinery, it was warm out. And there was a young man sitting there. He inshorts. And he had piped through legs. I'd never met you. But I know who this was. I walked towards him. I had so many emotions running through me. But I walked towards him. And as I picked my hand up, he picked his hands up to protect himself, like I was going to take a swing. But I didn't. I just reached forward. And I put my hand out and I said, hi, I'm Joel and Teeny. I saw a young man who had made a mistake. Over the next weeks and months, he lived in my town. I'd see him on the cliff. He was a gifted climber. When asked how Tali would have been, because with his pipes, he could either be five foot or up to six four, he said he didn't know how Tali would have been, because there's only seventeen when he lost his legs. In everything I've ever read, he has said or heard him say he has never failed to acknowledge what his actions caused. I'm still a professional guide. It's what I do this month. It's been forty-one years."

5,birthofanation.wav," I'm from a very small African country called Zimbabwe. It's a country that's been in the news very recently for very many bad reasons. The one thing you might not know about Zimbabwe is that it's one of the youngest democracies in the world. Well, democracies perhaps not the right word, so let me say it's one of the youngest countries in the world. It's only 29 years old. And the big year of change in my country, the big year of change in my family, and the big year of change for me was 1980 when my country finally became independent. Those of you, and I'm sure there are many of you here who are experts in African history, will know that in the late 50s and the early 60s, Britain, France, and the other colonial powers were giving up their colonies for a number of reasons. So countries like Nigeria became independent, Ghana became independent. But not Rhodesia. The white minority government in Rhodesia led by somebody called Ian Smith had other ideas for the kind of country they wanted to live in. And one of the very firm ideas they had was that they didn't want to live in a country ruled by black people. So they declared a unilateral declaration of independence from Britain, the colonial power. And the result of this was that the country was isolated from the outside. And on the inside there was a civil war between the white minority on the one side and the black majority led by black freedom fighters. And after about 14 years of war and negotiations in England, we finally became an independent republic called Zimbabwe. I have very vivid memories of that time. We lived in the township which were these African areas. Rhodesia was segregated along the same lines as South Africa, but on a smaller scale. So we lived in the township where I remember around the time of independence there was so much music. Everybody was singing, everybody was dancing. It was almost like you could actually touch the joy in the air. And the song that everybody was singing, if you'll allow me to sing it, is a song by Bob Mali called Zimbabwe. Do you know it? Then join in. Africa shall liberate Zimbabwe. Africa shall liberate Zimbabwe. It was a song that was on everybody's lips. Then the biggest thing that happened that she, for a lot of people in Harari, was that Bob Mali himself came to Sorsprey to give a concert, an independence concert. He came all the way from Kingston with his wailers. But that was not the biggest thing that happened to me because the biggest thing that happened to me was that the white areas, the formerly white areas, the suburbs began to open up. And my father finally achieved the dream of a lifetime. He moved us out of the township into the suburbs to live with the white people, the good area. So imagine what it meant for a family from the township, where the only road that was tarred was the road to town. And all the other little roads were dusty, full of mud, full of dust. There was no electricity at night in some parts of the township. So imagine us in this new environment where the roads aligned with beautiful trees. In the morning, the milkman deposits two bottles of milk outside your door. One silver, one gold, depending on the amount of cream you want in your milk. The breadman rings the bell in the morning to tell you that your fresh, low-boast bread is ready for you outside. And the newspaper boy throws his newspaper over the wall for you to read in the morning. I went to a school called Alfred Bites, where I found myself as one of 24 children in the classroom, 20 of them were white. Now I had been at a school in the township where we had something called hot seating, which meant that 48 of us came to school in the morning and then went home to make room for another 48 people who came in the afternoon. So this was absolute paradise to me, a class of only 24 children. But the very first thing I did in my new classroom was the wrong thing. My teacher, Miss Callan, called me to her desk. And as a well-trained little African girl who had been brought up well by her teachers, I nailed before her. What are you a goat? She said. I still remember the surprise laughter of the whole class. And it was a sound that I became very familiar with as the year went on. Because it seemed everything about me was wrong. Everything I did was wrong. My hair, for instance, not this hair. Well, this is my hair in the sense that I paid for it. But my hair was too curly, it was too close to my head. My English when it came was too slow and the accent was very strange. And then there was a small matter of the sandwiches. You see, my mother made us eggs sandwiches every morning for school. So she fried eggs, put them between butter slices of bread. But that was the wrong food to take to school. Because what's the white children ate was something called poloni, which really sank. And then they had something else called mamaite, which is a yeast extract and is the foulest tasting substance known to man. And I just, I really wanted this stinky, horrible food. Because I thought that, you know, if I ate the same food that the other people ate, if I had the same kind of hair, then I would fit in somehow. But of course, that didn't happen. So every day I had Russell wear bluffing at my hair. I had carried tree law, laughing at my hair. I had Natasha Russell refusing to share her smarties with me that she bought on holiday in South Africa. The only time that I really felt I belonged to Alfred Bite, my new school, was in the mornings at assembly, who would sit cross-legged on the floor. And Miss Roberts, our head mistress, would play the piano. And lead us in the school song. It was a song about valor, about duty, about honor. It was a song about commitment and dedication. And I sang it at the top of my voice because it was the one moment when I knew peace at my school when there was no laughter, when there was no more career on the playground. It was a song about the pioneer column, who colonized my country, and turned it into a reddita. So there I was, a 10-year-old African child in a newly independent country called Zimbabwe, singing this song in which God regarded the conquest of my country as an act of honor. This was a song celebrating the conquest of a kingdom in Zimbabwe. It was a song celebrating the fact that many thousands of people had been made landless. The song was called Thau, who did skyd our father's feet. And the last sentence was, as Thau has done, do once again. I love that song. As you can imagine, we didn't sing it for very long. My friend, Jesse Majrome, who has gone on to greater things and is now actually the deputy minister of justice in my country, told her father about the song that she was made to sing every morning. And her father called the herald, which was the state newspaper. And I remember the herald journalist coming to the school and Miss Roberts rushing across the quadrangle. And she was quite baffled by the whole thing. I'm not a racialist, she insisted. I have back children in my school. What do you mean? I'm a racist. That's not it at all. It's just a tradition. It's like the school motto. It's like the recorder lessons. It's just a tradition. It doesn't mean anything. I think that this was the moment that the teachers at my school and Miss Roberts finally had to confront what it meant to live in an independent African country. It wasn't just about changing the name of the country from Rhodesia to Zimbabwe, changing the name of the capital from South Brito Harare. It meant that not only did we have to start relating to each other differently across the racial divide, but we also had to start re-evaluating our history. And for some of the teachers, I think that was a step too far because about a year later came the great white flight, where a lot of teachers left the school and a lot of children left the school as well. I'm not really sure that I can relate the white flight to this particular incident. But what I know is that after a body year at my new school, it finally began to resemble the kind of school you'd expect to find in an independent African country. So I finally found myself being part of a school that had all the amenities that my old township lacked, but that truly looked like a Zimbabwe school. And this is how independence came to me. Thank you."
6,stagefright.wav," So it starts in 1989 and it's July and I'm on tour with my band and we're touring through Europe And this is a very usual thing. I had been touring for years and years seven or eight years by that point so It we had just come from Israel and we had landed in the UK in England So I had never been to Israel before and the first time you go there all the security is a bit daunting You know they search you and they search you again and they ask you questions and I found it a little scary So even though I really enjoyed my time there I was looking forward to coming back to England Which was very familiar to me. So this was we just landed in England. We were staying at the holiday in airport near Heathrow very glamorous So I wake up that morning and That night I'm going to play at the Glastonbury Festival in Glastonbury. So we have a journey to go to and it's probably going to be the biggest audience I'm ever going to face where there's supposed to be 75,000 or 80,000 people there and I'm headlining that night. It's a Friday night So I'm the last act on the show and all this is okay. This is fine I pack my stuff. I go downstairs to the to the front desk and There's some kind of altercation at the desk and I see my bass player Mike in he's looking really unhappy He's looking really pale and he's like half Puerto Rican half Italian so pale is not his usual color So I am concerned about this and then I also see my Tour manager also looking really upset my manager There's all this kind of buzzing going on. I'm like what's going on? So we all knew that there had been some girl that had a crush on Mike You know and this happens from time to time, you know girls fall in love with the guys in the band and I try and stay out of it You know and they send things or whatever and I try and lay down rules, you know We don't want random girls on the bus, but you can have your girlfriend or you can have your wife random girls off the bus But I kind of knew about this random girl because she It started off with little gifts that were coming backstage from Mike and milk that that was really cute and then after that Graduated to pictures of herself naked and you know well whatever So but then we all became worried because she had actually moved to Queens from London to be near him when we were not on tour and we all felt that that was going too far So now it turned out that now we're back in the UK and we are going to play Glastonbury and she has called him in the middle of the night and made these threats and said to him that she She and her friend who's a male guy who was also calling the hotel We're going to shoot him if he went out on stage that night So I'm like oh Got to hate I hate that kind of day So because I just want to be in England where it's just nice, you know, and it was comfortable and it was You know and Glastonbury is a festival of hippies basically. They have a big peace sign on the stage So and I'm thinking is this really going to happen but my manager feels that we should take it seriously So we call Scotland yard So we all waiting for mr. Scotland yard to show up the detective shows up and he takes the trip with us on the bus Mike is freaking out everybody's freaking out. So and I'm like, okay So he asks us some questions he finds out some things about this girl He finds out some things about the other man who was making the calls and this kind of thing So the tension is kind of building it's a long trip and we finally get there and we wind our way through this crowd of people And we're trying to find our way backstage to where the bus is supposed to be and it's kind of muddy I think it had rained and then it had stopped raining So now there's all this dust and stuff in the air and this is throngs of people and we're trying to find our way backstage And once we get there I feel that I I need to go for a walk I need a little Privacy and I try and and go for a walk I figure I'll check out some of the booths that are selling tie-dye things in militarious or bliss Mr. Scotland yard wants to walk with me and I'm like no, no, it's okay, you know you stay with Mike I'll be fine. No miss Bay Guy feel I really should come with you. No, I don't want you to come with me You can stay with Mike. I need to go off and he said no, so I said okay fine. I'll stay here then We were gonna go on stage at about 11 o'clock at about 9.30 suddenly 4 or 5 policemen show up and they come on to the bus and they want to have a little chat with me and I'm like why you know Mike will be fine He's gonna perform on the side of the stage. We have two bodyguards for Mike He's gonna perform in a bulletproof vest He's got the two bodyguards are there one looks like Mr. Clean and one looks like GI Joe and they're very handsome guys And they're gonna defend Mike's on my great. What's the problem? So the policemen sit me down and they said well, we didn't want to tell you this because we were we didn't want to upset you but Your life was also threatened. They also said Miss Vega if you go out on stage you will also get it So being that we have tracked down the woman, but we haven't tracked down her accomplice We feel that we need to inform you Legally that you should not do this show tonight. We feel that you should not perform on stage tonight so I'm like What are you kidding? This is Friday night. I'm headlining the glass and very festival. There's like a hundred thousand people What do you mean I'm not gonna do the show of course? I'm gonna do the show you know the show must go on What are you talking about? No one's gonna like shoot me on the glass and very stage under the peace sign So and then I'm thinking well anyway, you don't want to know what I was thinking so So I said no, no, I'm said I really have to do the show I feel that I really must and my my keyboard player who's also my boyfriend is looking at me with tears in his eyes And he's like no, no, I don't think you should do it. I'm like I'm sorry We have to do it. How can we possibly come back to England if we don't do this show? You know any crazy person can call up on the phone and say you know Whatever they're gonna say and then we they everybody would know that we canceled So they said okay, well, you'll have to wear the bulletproof vest as well. So I said okay The only one they had was his and this policeman was about 250 pounds and I'm like half that size So they put it on me and it's enormous And he strap me in and the gaffer's tape it closed So I'm like okay, and I'm like can I still play the guitar? I think so and then I have a they put a huge denim Jacket on over that to no one sees the bulletproof vest So now I'm all decked out like a turtle like this in my arms are kind of like this and I'm like okay But you know, I felt really strongly that we should we should go on we should risk our lives You know this is rock and roll this is what this is what we do so I remember that moment as I was walking out on the stage and I see the microphone there and I'm in my denim jacket and my Gaffer's tape and my bulletproof vest and things start to feel like I'm going underwater and as I'm heading for the microphone the thought suddenly occurs to me that they could shoot me in the head and I'm like oh I wish I hadn't thought that right now, but I'm not thinking about that anymore I'm just heading for the microphone and then I pick up the guitar and I start singing and The other thing that happened was that now The whole situation is escalated to the point where there's 20 policemen in front of the stage There's a hundred thousand people behind them. There's people as far as the eye can see from the stage all the way to the horizon This is like several villages or something Not only that, but there's helicopters overhead and they've decided to train the lights Not on the stage which they usually do but from time to time they swivel the lights onto the audience To search them to see if they see anyone with a weapon. So I'm singing every song feels like it's taking 20 minutes long Small blue thing just seems to go on forever and I'm looking at everybody is so often these swivel the lights onto the audience and I'm like You know Then I continue to play and every so often I turn around to look at Mike Of course he's not there, you know Mike is over there with mr. Clean and GI Joe and There's the his Amplifier on the floor. So it's like where's Mike? Oh There's his amp So blah blah. I'm playing it's all going pretty well. I'm thinking wow. This is great that we're alive and Suddenly my keyboard player approaches me and he says sing Luca and get off stage I'm like why and he goes I can't tell you right now, but we have to get off stage by 12.30 I'm like okay And then I start thinking well, why did they want me to get off stage? Did they find some did they find the weapon? Did they find the girl? Did they find her accomplice? Maybe I should just get off stage and not sing Luca Luca was my big hit at that point and it was and I decided no we're gonna stay We're gonna sing Luca. We're gonna entertain everybody have come to be entertained. We have to do this I sing Luca everybody's cheering and come off stage and it feels like it's going in slow motion and I said What happened did they find the girl? No? Did they find her accomplice? No? Did they find somebody with a weapon? No? Well, why did we have to get off stage at 12.30? And then the Promoter of the festival comes over to me and says with Miss Vega We didn't get a chance to explain this to you before but the festival has a curfew because The farmers in the next field have the cows and the cows get disturbed if you sing past 12.30 and it makes them less productive And that's my story You"
7,myfathershands.wav," I always remember loving my father's hands. In the mid 60s and the early 70s, I was probably about this high, and I would put my chin right where his typewriter was. And you have one of those old stacked key typewriters. Remember that, that sound was ever present, and it was like white noise in our childhood. And he was also a draftsman. He did these beautiful drawings with charcoal, and he would use his fingers. They would turn black, pushing the material around a shade or contour a figure drawing. And I saw his fingers in wet clay. There was just a grace about his fingers and his hands that I just always remember being fascinated by. He was also a bipolar. And if you don't know what that is, it's just basically a chemical imbalance that will make you, you know, maybe very excitable and high sometimes, and also very low sometimes. It can be very scary, frankly, for a young family. And it was for me and my sisters. And just to give you a full of picture, I mean, that sort of feeling of uneasiness, I loved my dad, and he was creative and he was brilliant and could be very entertaining. But just emotionally didn't feel safe. For the last probably 15 plus years of his life, my sisters didn't speak to him. I, on the other hand, decided after lots of therapy and men's work and men's work is when you try to get closer to your dad and try to heal wounds usually. And it enabled me to commit to have breakfast with him every Sunday. And I remember one Sunday, my one of my sisters said, how can you do that? And I said, it's service work. And she laughed and I said, I'm not kidding. I mean, it really was that hard to have breakfast with him. It was just that I didn't feel safe. So anyway, that was when he was 70. Well, when he was 82, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. I didn't know anything about it. It scared me and I called, you know, got online, did looked up everything I could learn about it. And I found Houston Alzheimer's Association, great organization, by the way. And they had these classes and they would put the patients, my dad included in one classroom and they'd put me and the other caregivers in the other classroom. And afterward, we'd come and have lunch and talk about things. And, you know, it was the kind of stuff you never want to have to talk about, period on Earth. And yet, we got closer. And my heart certainly opened a little bit, knowing that one day he might look at me and not know who I was. So, going to pick him up one Sunday and for our obligatory Sunday breakfast, and it's not obligatory anymore. I want to be with my dad now, because I know that time might be short. And we're driving along and I look down and his 82-year-old hand, a beautiful 82-year-old hand, is sitting there on the middle console. And I just had this nice thought. I want to hold my father's hand. And I'm driving and I came to a red light and I looked down and I couldn't do it. And I was so scared. And all these things were going through my head. Like, you know, you did all this therapy and you, you know, you did all this therapy. And you did all this therapy and you did all this therapy. And then I thought, you know, how many times did my dad hold my hand? Little hardwood's hand, you know, as a boy, as a child. Maybe my little hand in his hand, maybe every day, you know, thousands of times. What's wrong with me? Well, luckily, or saved by the green light, you know, I started driving again, turning the silver in my head, and I come to the next red light. I look down and I see his hand again and I just say, I want to hold my father's hand. I can't do it. You know, I thought, is he going to use that sharp wit and say something mean to me? Is he going to pull his hand away? Would he hit me? Is he had hit me? So I remember I was here in Houston and I turned on the Heights Boulevard. And there was a stop sign. And there wasn't anybody behind us. There happened to be a woman sitting on a bench. I don't know why we caught eyes. And when I took my hand off the steering wheel, you know, it was just a few inches to touch my father's hand, but it might as well have been my foot leaving a thousand foot bungee jump. It was the scariest thing I did in my life. And when I touched his hand, immediately his other hand came over and covered my hand. And it was, it was like he'd been waiting for me to do that. And it felt strangely familiar, like we had been doing it forever. For the last two years of my father's life, whenever we went anywhere in a car, we held hands."
8,adollshouse.wav," All right, thank you very much. All right, this is my story. State and this girl, like two years ago, been dating her for eight months, since she wanted to meet my parents. She's really giving me shit. How come I haven't met your parents, girl? And I never brought anybody home. I was like 30 years old. Never met brought anybody home. I didn't ever meet people in general. I didn't want to meet her parents. I always hated when you had to meet like, you know, go out with somebody, you gotta like meet their friends and shit. I was sitting at the table trying to be interesting. I usually end up just sitting there staring at like mashed potatoes and some shit. So she's like, you know, how come, what's wrong with you? You know, how come you don't want to meet me, you know, bring your home to meet your parents? I started thinking about it. Like, you know, not only had I never brought anybody home, you know, a girl home. I was 30 years old. I'd never brought anybody home. Even like back in like first grade, like second grade, I may have friends and shit. I just never brought them home. So I started thinking like, you know, how the hell did that start? You know, as you know, we're basically driving up from New York to go to my house to finally meet my parents. And I remember like, I think it was like when I was first grade, we set up a bus stop and it was like right out front of my house, my parents used to always be arguing. And my dad was like a maniac, you know, oh, he's screaming, God damn fucking bitch. Just total psycho. My dad was like a complete psychopath, you know? Like his nickname in my house was called the thing. Because that's what he was. He was like, use his fucking thing. That like if he wasn't around, we say, dude, is the thing home? You know, if he wasn't home, you could chill. He's just like never in a good mood. So one day I'm down at the bus stop. There's like, you know, ten other kids down there and shit around like in first grade, second grade, third grade waiting for the bus. And it's like, tours and so on. Sometimes my parents go like the windows open and shit. So I can start to hear like an argument starting like, well, what the fuck do you mean? You didn't know. And I'm sitting there, like, please, please let the bus come, please. But Christ say, I was like, you got damn fucking bitch. I was screaming this shit. And I remember just looking at all the other kids looks on their faces like, I guess, you know, this is like way before cable. So most kids never even heard curses. They couldn't believe it. And I was just, that's when it really hit me. The man, my family's really screwed up. And I started going to other kids' houses and that parents seemed to get along and they were like, cool. And so the whole time I'm driving back, my girlfriend coming up, all this stuff is like coming back and I'm thinking, and I like really, and like, all like, like I'm a six year old kid again, like getting all nervous, like how my dad is gonna like act. Because it's like embarrassing, you know? I mean, I remember like, like, he was one of these dudes where like, I don't know, he's just always in a bad mood. If you try to like teach us something, he'd say it once. And then when you didn't get it, he'd just say it louder and louder. And I remember six, it's going this guy, he's retarded. Like I remember, we got a dog and he's trying to teach his dog how to sit. All right, it's a dog. It doesn't speak English and he's sitting there going to think he's like, going, he's going, all right, sit. It's a little puppy, sit. Sit out! You're gonna get over there and you're gonna sit out! Dogs sitting there like walking around like, peeing like, what the fuck is wrong with this guy? That was like his thing, man. Everything like in my house, my parents, they were like ridiculously strict. They had all these stupid rules. I remember they had like this one rule, whatever you didn't eat for dinner, they would just like wrap it in cellophane and you had to like eat it the next morning for breakfast. And there's like, everybody's sitting there like pancakes and waffles. You're like eating like cube steaks and shit. You'd be like, the dad be going, come on, eat it! I don't want to eat it! Eat it! So I'm like driving back and that's all I'm thinking. It's like, God, this guy's just gonna completely embarrass me. And I don't know, it's just, I just felt weird. Like my family was like, you know what my family was like, loving, like build somebody up. Like our family was just all of us just like, ripping somebody down. Like, I think the worst thing he ever did to me, this is the one that really kind of made me like the anxious, like worried some person that I remember. He was right around Christmas. I was really thinking this because I was driving this girl up for Christmas. He was giving me shit when they always hated when I was joking around. I think making my mother laugh somehow was, I don't bug him or whatever. So he kept giving me shit. Come on, man, you know, you keep joking around. You know, giggling all the time, you act like a little girl. I'm thinking like, because he's always fucking with me. I'm going, God, he has a new angle. You know, yes, I'm for a football, for Christmas, you act like a little girl, what the fuck's wrong with you? I'm just sitting like, oh jeez. So like two weeks later, it's Christmas time. I got like four brothers, right? Maybe we sneak down to go look at the presents. So we go downstairs, right? There's all these gifts down there, all wrapped. We're all looking to see who got what, you know? There's always little tags to ed from Santa. You know, be like, you know, to bar from on my dad or whatever. And I'm sitting there. Let's wait a second. So I look. And like the middle of the tree, I see there's a doll. And I'm thinking I got four brothers. What the fuck is there a doll sitting here? And I'm just looking to the sun. You're just like those Spike Lee movies were like the background movies and the character doesn't. You just say one of those deals. And I look up at this doll, right? And it says, do bill from Santa. And I'm like, what the fuck? God, got me a goddamn doll. It came downstairs and he's laughing and shit. And he's making me take a picture. I'm like six years old and crying and stuff. And I'm thinking of this shit. I'm pulling into the driveway. And I'm like freaking out. Because I'm finally going to bring somebody home to meet this fucking maniac. And I'm telling her, you know, I don't know how this guy's going to be or whatever. So he walked into the house. You know, it's like candles and candles. You know, Christmas tree. It's all real nice, dim lights and stuff. She comes in, she meets my dad. And the dude is like totally normal. After me building this guy up the whole ride back, he's like fucking like, you know, that dude from Leave It To Beaver. He's like the nicest guy ever. He's all cordial. And I remember I'm just getting like pissed at the guy. Go, why isn't he being a dick? And she's sitting there and there taking me and saying, oh, he's the greatest guy. And he's like, I can't believe you're saying all this stuff. He's such, you know, he's smart, he's intelligent, he's so interested in what I have to say. I remember I was like, I was so pissed at the guy. I mean, I really hated him when I was growing up. To the point I remember the time he went on the driveway and he was running out to his car and he slipped and fell and broke his shoulder. And at that point, me and my brother was so fucking hated this guy. And when he came to the house and my mother's like taking care of him, we snuck out the back door to look at his footprints in the snow to see where he slipped and fell. And I'm telling you, we were laughing our asses off at this guy. You're right there, right there. Fuck, why couldn't I have seen that? So he ended up being like the sweetest guy ever. And there was nothing anxious about it. I was like worried about it for like, I don't know from the beginning of the time, dating girls like 15. And I just ended up feeling really stupid. And I was kind of pissed. I was just looking at the guy, go, why the fuck couldn't you have been like this? You know, 20 years ago when I needed him to be like that. Rather than, you know, being the way he was. And that's my story. Thanks."
9,gpsformylostidentity.wav," Last summer, I found out that my identity had been stolen. It was the weekend of a friend's wedding, and I was standing outside the Memorial Church at Stanford University for the rehearsal when I called my bank to make sure I could clear an important check. You may dial an extension at any time. The bank associate told me that this would be impossible as my account was almost $10,000 over drawn. She then asked me if I was calling from Mexico. I looked around at Stanford's sprawling green, students playing frisbee, tourist snapping photographs, and told the woman that I was fairly certain I wasn't. Laura Dave, most recently called to inform us she was in Mexico. She replied, If you're not there, then who are you? My head started to hurt. It would continue to hurt as the details emerged over the next few days. This person had acquired a debit card in my name and had used it to spend tens of thousands of dollars. In going over every debit charge, the bank associate asked me if I'd shopped at Victoria's Secret. Like, ever? I asked. Do you know what the meat barn is? She asked. No, I said. Did I want to know? Definitely not. Still, the gravity of the situation hadn't really sunk in. I thought it would all be taken care of with a few phone calls. Then, the first police detective I spoke with said, Get ready, kid. Once someone gets a hold of your identity, you have to fight the good fight to get it back. This is just the beginning. Could he be right? I thought I was coming to the end of a period in which I had already fought the good fight, a period in which I had asked and answered many questions about my identity. Following a breakup the fall before, I had struggled to feel like myself again. During those first few months, the version of me that I'd recognize as being essentially generous and open to the world seemed to have temporarily disappeared. At warp speed, I'd gone from easy going to confrontational. When a friend called in the middle of the night to tell me he was having trouble with his wife, I told him to look in the mirror and begin therapy. When another asked what I thought about her quitting a job she hated and moving to South America, I told her that when I believed she was serious about being that brave, we could have that conversation. Historically, I was the friend other sought out for relationship advice or to discuss a complicated family problem. I prided myself on being nonjudgmental, but clearly as I aimed to start over, that me was closed for business. I needed to return to my most independent self, which translated into not having much room for other people. I dived into work, dived into exercise, and avoided diving into relationships, romantic or otherwise, at all costs. And almost accidentally, I found myself straddling two lives. A new one I was starting in Los Angeles, and the one I had left in New York. A four-day trip to Southern California in the spring turned into work opportunities, which led to months of flying back and forth. This was moving forward, wasn't it? Only maybe it wasn't. Maybe it was just moving around, which isn't at all the same thing. This is where I was. Post-wedding weekend at a coffee shop somewhere off Highway 101 on my way back to Los Angeles, in this real position, of proving to skeptical strangers on the other end of credit hotlines that I was, who I said I was. But I couldn't give them an accurate address. Did I live in California or New York? I couldn't receive the facts forms they needed me to fill out because I had no access to a fax machine. A landline phone number? Sorry. Don't have one. I couldn't even tell them where I was going to be next week. And I had unwittingly organized my life so that I was far away from nearly everyone who could remind me of myself. Which of these can I help you with? Another epic phone call this time with a credit union revealed that not only had the new Laura emptied my checking account, she had also opened at least seven credit card accounts in my name. After I hung up, a woman at the nearby table gave me a kind smile. I didn't mean to listen in, but my sister-in-law got her identity stolen too, she said. And it all turned out all right. I asked. Not really. It was a nightmare that went on for years. I got back into my car, turned on the radio as high as it would go and continued toward Los Angeles. I began wondering, how could I not have known this was all happening? What was I going to do to stop it? Just then, I realized I was about to pass the turn off that leads to the Monterey Peninsula and Big Sur. The first time I had gone to Big Sur, I was nine years old and on a road trip with my family. As we hit the expanse of highway one between Carmel and Big Sur, that almost impossible stretch of road carved into the divide of steep mountain rock and ocean, I had the strongest visceral reaction I'd had to any place in the world. My father pulled the car over and as my brother tells it, I started to cry because I was so happy. I tended toward melodrama as a child. But I can remember with great clarity sitting across from my father at a Woodsy restaurant and Big Sur that evening and looking past him at the window at the confluence of mountains and ocean with a feeling of amazement and an awareness I had never experienced before. Not unlike falling in love for the first time, such intense feelings can make you feel small in their grasp. Or if it's a good love, a kind one, you can feel the opposite, bigger than you are, braver, more certain of yourself. Three years ago, after I had finished writing my first book, I returned to Big Sur and spent a washed out January staring out at those cliffs, the highway closed to the south by storm damage, and to the north by fallen rock brutal enough that I didn't venture far that way either. I had a black umbrella and big boots and took long walks each afternoon. The ventana wilderness soggy and completely unaccommodating, humbling in the best way. It was a happy time, and while I had gone back there intending to start a new project, what I did instead other than take walks was a whole lot of nothing. Something had never filled my days so expansively, which is part of the allure of the place, and ease with itself that invites you in a little at a time, eventually reminding you in big and small ways of your own humanity. And now here I was again, about to miss the turn, but this time in serious need of a positive force. A detour, especially this detour, was not the wisest plan. I had police reports to file, paperwork that was due yesterday. The officer's words echoed in my mind, kid, this is just the beginning. Still, I took the exit. As I passed Carmel and began winding through those mountainside curves and bridges towards Big Sur Valley, it was late afternoon and turning very windy. I kept the windows open anyway. My first stop was that Woodsy Restaurant on the Cliffs Edge where I had eaten with my family two decades ago, and where I'd also had Sunday night dinner during that rain drenched January. I walked inside and took in the familiar Mahogany bar and high rafters, and those windows, offering uninterrupted views of the ocean and mountains. The restaurant was closed for dinner setup, but the day manager let me go out to the terrace, where I settled in at a table with a mug of coffee and watched the sunset. Henry Miller, who loved Big Sur and made it his home once said, that until we lose ourselves, there is no hope of finding ourselves. I thought about the other Laura walking around in Mexico, spending my money, and even speaking to officials at my bank, all in an apparently convincing performance of me. And here I was, the real me unable to tell in ways that ostensibly mattered, a convincing story about who I was. It made me wonder for a moment if maybe she was actually a better candidate for being me than I was. But sitting on that terrace, the peacefulness that enveloped me when I stepped into the restaurant began changing into a kind of bedrock familiarity, and all that once I felt completely like myself. Not the self who had been tested or the self who was still figuring out where she was going next, but the one beneath all that, the self I had become acutely aware of my first time in Big Sur, the girl who was an awe of the world around her and her place in it. Maybe this is what we get in life, a few great loves, loves that return us to ourselves when we need it most, and maybe some of those loves aren't people, but places. Real and adopted homes that fill us up with light and energy and hope at moments when we feel especially tired or lost. That is the beauty of love in all its forms. We don't know when or how it's going to save us."
10,odetostepfather.wav," Under the influence is our topic tonight, and I thought of a lot of different things. And the one I kind of wanted to talk about was my secret influence. There are people in our lives that are incredibly important to us. And I would even mention to say some of the most important people, everybody aside from my mother in my life, doesn't know anything about this person who I think about every day. And his name was Michael Markwis. And so it's just a violin piece, it would be called ode to Michael Markwis. I met him when I was seven years old, and I was growing up. My mother had left my father when I was about two or three. And this was the first man that my mother had brought home, like for me to me. And he was a Vietnam vet. He was a professional athlete. He had played college football, college baseball. He was a ski instructor and a golf instructor. He had like a big beard and he drank scotch and he had a German shepherd and he had a lab. And he had this unbelievable MG. And not like this little like Wussi MGs, you see, like it was like a 1933 MG. It was like a motorcycle. I mean, this thing was so cool. The doors went super low. I mean, it was just so cool. And he was so cool. And he was the first person to really tap into, he may have tapped into it. He may have created it. I'm not sure, but a mama's boy complex, which was that I had, I hadn't been, my father lived in Texas. And I hadn't been to Texas since I was about three. But I was obsessed. I had a Dallas Cowboys belt buckle. I would wear like, you know, flower t-shirts, you know, like, grand Parsons or something like that. I mean, it's just about 1977. I was very into that. I only listened to Willie Nelson's a red-headed stranger. My room was covered with cowboys and Broncos and Indians. And like anything Texas was up my alley. And he met me and he's like, why, what's all the Texas stuff? You know? He's like, well, you know, my dad lives in Texas. Well, he ain't here, is he? I'm like, no, is that, well, I think I'd get over the Texas thing if I were you. I'd be like, yeah, I really hurt my feelings. And he proceeded to like latch into this thing. Like, so what do you, mama's boy? Cowboys lost today. Did your dad call? No, right? He's a very tough guy. Very tough guy. And through a little bit of what my mother felt was kind of abusive behavior, I grew to love him. Right? I mean, I hated him, but I loved him. I thought about him all the time and what he would think about something. And like, for example, he decided that since I was so into football, but you don't know how to play football, you know? What name, no, any, do you dad teach you to play football? No, I don't think he did. He did. All right, come on. Let's play football. No, I'm not looking for the pity thing. It was really pretty funny. I mean, he was a funny guy. He was trying to help me in his own weird way. So he takes me outside. He takes me outside and he says, all right, I'm going to teach you how to play football. All right, but football is a man's game. It's not a mama's boy's game. All right? You put, you make a diamond with your hands, you thumb to your four fingers. And if you can touch it, you can catch it. So I'm like, all right. You know, and you say, you still with me? You still want to play football? I'm like, yeah, I want to play football. It's like, all right, if you can touch it, you can catch it. Bam, you know, and it just went on. I mean, and it was freezing outside. And my nose is bleeding and I'm crying and I want to go inside. He's like, you know, you got to catch this football. And so finally, I catch it like three times. He's like, all right, see? You know, that's such a little mama's boy after all. And I feel kind of good about myself. I mean, you know, I mean, go figure, you know? So my mom really liked him. And we moved to Vermont. And he took us and he moved us into this one bedroom, one not just a one room cabinet from out. Whereas he had this gig as a ski instructor. And it was really picturesque. And he really had it in his heart, like, to teach me how to be a man. You know, we would, he taught me how to chop wood. And he bought me a jeans jacket. And he would have my mom do like patches on the back. You know, and it was really very cool. And I started to feel very cool. He took me to see the man who would be king. And, you know, I cried at the end, which is, this is a digression I'm going to regret doing this. But it's my favorite line. And since I have an audience I have to tell you, it's like Sean Connery is standing on the burning bridge. And Michael Cain, he's the bridges burning. He's going to die. Michael Cain struts out, you know? Peachy, will you ever forgive me for being so bleeding stupid and so bloody arrogant. And Sean Connery says, you know, that I can and that I do. And like, Michael and I sat there and I just cried. And he's like, pull yourself together, man. We got in the car, I got a little MG and it's like freezing. And I'm crying. And he's like, I, it's a good movie. It was sad, but it was, you know, you got it. You know, I loved it too. I loved it too. But like from then on in my mind, like Michael and I were, you know, Michael Cain and Sean Connery and adventures and things. And we had them, you know what I mean? I had to walk, I mean, it's really kind of picture us. I had to walk like two miles to school. And I was only in second grade. And it was very fun. He insisted that I do it, you know, by myself. And my mother had a lot of problems with them. Like the, the, like my, when my mother would go, she had to go out to town a couple times. And he would take me on dates with other women. And like, if you tell your mother, I'm going to kick your ass. And I thought it was great. I mean, again, like you keep being judgmental. And I was like, I was like, this guy is so cool. And remember, I like rolled joints for him for this other girl. I have this vague memory of it. And finally, like my most pivotal memory of him, aside from the closing of my story, is we had, you know, this little one-room cabin. I mean, it was really, really idyllic. No, and Vermont, and all this other stuff. And Michael, we're out on this little deck outside of it. And Michael's like, see that? Look at that buck. Look at that buck. Look at that. Get the shotgun, Ethan. Get the shotgun. You know, and I'm like, what for? We're going to kill it. Yeah, we're going to die. I'm like, I'm like, mom! Michael's going to kill a buck. Michael's going to kill a buck. I'm like, I'm going to say, heal. I was going to let you shoot it. You blew it, you know? And I didn't want to shoot it, but now I feel like I should have wanted to shoot it. And like, I don't know, I feel very strange. Doesn't exactly make sense, but you can understand subconscious, very influenced. And so, finally one day, I come walking home from school with this little cabin, and all my mother's underwear and lingerie kind of like things are nailed to the outside of the house. Right? This is a true story, all right? And I'm like, wow, that's weird, you know? And inside, there's like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know? And, you know, we basically get in the car and we're going. And we move to Atlanta, Georgia. And, you know, I don't know any more about what happened there than you do. I mean, Long Shiree, Friday, I can guess, you know, but I've never asked my mom. My mom has a lot of issues, but that's not, this is Michael's ode. And so anyway, we move to Atlanta, Georgia. And what happens is, my father gets remarried. And for some reason, to my now eight-year-old mind, this is very disturbing. I'm not invited to the wedding, and I'm very upset about this. And it's kind of throwing my whole Texas fantasy scheme apart. But I mean, it's like weird school in Atlanta, Georgia. And I actually get accepted to this little gifted and talented program, like for an eight-year-old, right? And I go to, and I get kicked out on the second day, because I told some kid that his painting sucked, right? Or the teacher, I didn't get kicked out right away. I had to write a one-page essay about why I was supposed to write about why saying somebody's painting sucked was a bad thing. And I wrote in my essay that I didn't know that it was something bad, because my mother goes out with lots of guys. And the last one that she dated told me, I sucked all the time. And I didn't think it was that big a deal. Now, that sounds like the truth is, I knew exactly what I was doing. Like, I was trying to make my mom look bad in front of the teachers to deflect me being in trouble. My mom was so angry at me. She got this call from the station and she hangs up. You little shit. I don't date lots of guys. And Michael didn't say you sucked. Yes, he did. All right, he did. Anyway, the point is, and then I got to find, I got kicked out of this gifted and talented thing. It was like a big deal. And my father's getting remarried and they sent me to a child psychologist. And my mom comes up with this idea that she's going to invite Michael to come to my birthday. Like that, I could really use this. Right? But I don't know about this. But so my birthday arrives. And we're living in Atlanta, Georgia now. And who comes down the street in a little MG with the gold retriever right in the side thing. And his hair and his beard. And he's got this thing. And a bunch of presents in the back comes pulling up. And it was really one of the greatest moments in my life. I mean, I was so happy to see him. And I had all these boys come over for my birthday party. And Michael took turns taking us around the block. And he would like peel out fish tail around the thing. And my mother would be screaming, I called at him in all the boys. He'd be like, your dad is so cool. And I'd be like, I know. I know. He's so cool. And I was just, it's really one of those glorious days. Michael took us all the Chuck E. Cheeses. And we went to see George Burns and O God. And everybody was just so into Michael. And I by, you know, association was a very studly guy. And so then it's the night's over. And Michael's going to leave. You know, Michael says goodbye. And I say, all right, see you later. And he starts to go. And I go to my room and I start saw. Right. And so my mother comes in and it's like, what are you crying about? It's like nothing, nothing. You know, I just, I wish Michael was going to stay longer, you know. And she's like, all right. And she goes outside. And okay. But yeah, go, go, go. And it's very good. Very good timing. Very good timing. Like Pat Raleigh would say, it's all good. So much for him. But so Michael comes into my room. And I'm devastated. Because as much as I would like and everything for him to talk to me and everything, I am so upset, you know. And I really don't want him to see me like this, you know. And he tells me that, you know, he's, you know, he's going to stay in touch with me. Don't worry, you know, my mom's up in the ass. We all know that. But I'm going to stay in touch with you. You're a great kid, you know. And it might even tell me he loved me. I mean, he was really being really nice. And he drove from Vermont to Georgia for a day. And so, and then he leaves. And you know, like I watch him drive away. It's like night now. And I watch the MG and the Golden Retriever like take off. And my mom comes back in the house and I hear it. And I just scream out the room like, I am never going to speak to you again. You know, I felt so betrayed by her. Because if Michael was going to leave, I wanted him to think I didn't care, you know. And he, and I never saw him again, you know. And I got a message, my mother got a message about two or three years ago, or something that she Googled Michael Marcus. No, she didn't. That she had heard from him and that, like, he's awesome movie I did. And thought that I was doing really great. And really meant a lot to me. Because, you know, nobody, I know knows him, but I carry him with me every day. And he's been the secret influence of my life. Thank you."
11,forgettingfear.wav," It's 10am. A siren is heard across the country. Everybody stops everything and stands in attention. The whole country is posing for one minute of silence. It's a major violation of social rules if you don't, so everybody does it. Men, women, children, everybody. Accept my debt. It just sits there, continues to read the newspaper and sits his morning coffee. He doesn't even try to tone down the, hmm, he says. That's how I know Memorial Day for the Holocaust started. This happens once a year, and it fell right on my yearly visit to Israel. The day before I take a walk in our industrial neighborhood, I see the corner where I had this horrible accident with my skateboard, but I didn't cry. I figured if my debt went through the Holocaust, surely I can handle a little pain. One summer my parents travel and they sent me up north to a keyboard to stay until they're back. There I met a group of Germans who came to volunteer. It's the first time I see German people. The neighborhood kids used to beat me up for looking like a German, and indeed I blend right in. The leader of the group is Johann. Every night we hang out together after work. With eight grade level English, I tell him about my hometown, Rishon Lezion, and he tells me about Berlin. One evening, Jan brings a book of poems. I think he's about to kiss me, but I keep my cool and say, cool, go ahead and read. Suddenly, I heard this flood of words in German. Fandile von Schtuk, it was a poem by Friedrich Schiller, who has my surname. That was a surprise. Johann goes on and on. These German words are pouring out of his mouth. I never heard it so closely before. It's terrifying. I start to see images of Nazis pushing Jews into trailers, skeletal humours behind barbed wires, smoke coming out of gas chambers, until I scream stop and I push Johann off me. Jan sits there all flustered. What am I going to say that my entire life, the only time I heard German was in Holocaust movies, that the Germans did something to my dead, but I don't know what, because he never talks about it. Somehow, it doesn't feel like our after-work conversation. So I just say, it hurts, and I point to his foot that he's stepping on my toes. After this, I think there's something wrong with my memory. It's not my memory, it's my dead. Actually, it's not even his, because he never mentioned any of his memories. Still, I have these vivid images of horrific pain, and I feel intimate with death, which is very unfortunate as I would much rather be intimate with Johann. I need to do something about it. Plan A, hard to hard conversation with my dead. I ask him, dead, what happened? Why don't you ever stand in attention during the siren? He says nothing and leaves the room. Plan B, go to college. Here, I take some classes about the psychoanalytic theory of Freud. I think my dead would be interested, especially because his name is also Ziegmund. He listens quietly as I explain, and when I'm done, he says, psychology is a serious load of crap. So I decide to measure in psychology. However, people talking about their emotions could be time-consuming, so I decide to focus on a simpler form of human behavior, mice. I like them. They never talk about emotions, just like my dead, only small and furry. Every day I watch their behavior, when they sense the smell of a predator, they freeze in the corner. When they hear the sound of a bell, they freeze in the other corner. I try to change their behavior, but they never forget what they're afraid of. In 2004, a new movie is out, eternal sanction of the spotless mind. The main character wants to erase Clementine, his ex-girlfriend from his memories. He goes to a doctor who has this innovative technique to erase memories. The state of the art technology is a helmet you put on your head with some wires. The helmet technology inspires me. I discover that the movie is based on a true experiment. There's a relab at NYU that did the actual experiment. I manage to get some government funding back my bags and move to New York. I show up at the very lab that did the experiment and ask for a job. These NYU scientists found a way to change memories. They say that just the act of remembering makes the memory vulnerable. So, you take your memory out of storage, it's loading their defenseless, that's where they hid it with a drug. So now you can't put it back in storage, it's blocked by the drug. So, it looks like there's one way memory lane, which I think is genius. The only problem is that the only indication that this is true is in the form of a furry mouse that stopped freezing in the corner. So, they give me a job. My mission is to show that this actually works in real human beings. The way to do it is simple. I want people to the lab and give them electric shocks. Before each shock, I show them a blue square. After a few times, I don't need to give the shocks anymore. They're really afraid of the blue squares. The next phase is to give the drug and get rid of the fear. One problem is, I don't actually have the drug. Experiments in humans are complicated, more than mice, because of federal laws. So, they're really strict about giving drugs to people, but pretty lenient about giving them electric shocks. So, I can only do half the experiment. Currently, until this day, there's a subset of New York population who's really afraid of blue squares. As I try to overcome this minor setback, something happens. A bunch of mice in a nearby lab is doing something different. By mistake, they were doing something nice while relieving their bed memory. I think these mice are wrong to something. Maybe there's a way to rewrite the memory without the drug. The idea is, you take the memory out of storage and you link it with something nice, like the good feelings you have when you win a prize, then you put it back in storage, but it's different. It has this new information. Your memory is only as good as your last retrieval of it. With this idea in mind, I test it on people and it works. At least as far as blue squares go, I can rewrite their memory and they're not afraid of them anymore. So now, I'm back in Israel for my yearly visit. It's 10 a.m. and the siren goes on to mark the openings of the Holocaust Memorial Day. Everybody stops and stands still to reminisce about the horrors of World War II. My dad sits there with his newspapers sipping his morning coffee. I think I finally understand what's going on. The siren is his blue square, he's doing something pleasant while his memory is vulnerable. So I pour myself a cup, borrow a section of his paper and sit next to him."
12,sweetaspie.wav," I embarked on a journey toward the sea of matrimony at the perilous age of 41. Yeah, you think 41, a trip to marriage would be pretty smooth, but nobody had told my family. My sister called me up and she said, you have to order engraved invitations. I said, I don't think so, we're having a potluck. She called again, people are asking me what to get you for a wedding present. You have to register at stores. I said, I don't think so, we're combining two apartments. We've got so many duplicates, we're trying to figure out what to give away. But they want to give you presents, she said, we know that's why we're having a potluck. They can all bring food. Our simple invitations went out and I received a phone call from one of my aunts. I'm looking at your invitation, she said, and I see this thing about bringing a dish for the potluck. I'm wondering, is the dish supposed to be your wedding present? No, no, it's an ordinary potluck, you bring the food, take your dish home. It's just a potluck. My mother developed this obsession with nuts and mints. A required for a wedding, she says, every table must have nuts and mints. You have to order the mints, they can call or coordinate with your wedding. And Valera said, mom, mom, look, be in charge of the nuts and mints. They can be your contribution to the potluck. My brother called. Is Charles going to cut his hair? I don't know. Well, he's going to shave off his beard, isn't he? I don't know. Well, why don't you know? If you tell him he'll cut his hair, he'll shave his beard. Well, why would I do that? Well, of course you should do that. You're going to be marrying him. I said, but it's his head and his face. And besides, he's going to be my husband, not my property. A couple of weeks before the wedding, my father called. Mary, I don't know. He's not from around here. We don't know his people. I said, I know, daddy, his parents were older, they're dead. I'm not going to be to me, either. And Mary, around here, men just don't make pies. Yes, my husband. My husband to be had committed the grievous error of showing up at the Hamilton family Thanksgiving bearing homemade apple pies. Yet not by the crust, open a can of apple pie feeling and dump it in. Apple pies, no, measure the flour, roll out the dough, peel and cut the apples homemade apple pies. Yes. Well, finally, January came and we got married. A few months later on Easter Sunday, our phone rings. And it's my mother. Hey, Mary, we're on our way to see grandkids to give them an Easter basket. And we thought we'd stop by your place and give you your Easter gifts if that's okay. And the staff of the phone told my husband about the call and he said, Easter gifts. Were we supposed to have Easter gifts? And I said, no, no, no, something's up. I just don't know what. For my Easter gift, my parents gave me a lovely hair barrett. For his Easter gift, they gave him a deep dish Louisville stoneware pie plate. Yeah. It was the closest I knew my parents would ever be able to come to saying, you were right. We were wrong about him. It has been 20 years since that Easter. And my sister finally got to order engraved invitations when her own daughters got married. My brother still holds to the point of view that it is perfectly okay for others to legislate what people should do about their bodies, even when they do not inhabit those bodies. My mother is now probably making sure everyone she shares the afterlife with or enjoying that's meant. And me and Charles were still enjoying sailing on that sea of matrimony, him with his long hair and beard still wearing it. And me wearing a few extra pounds thanks to 20 years of fabulous homemade pie."
13,goingthelibertyway.wav," It was the first time I was going on a Christian date, and I was freaking the hell out. I was in my dorm at Liberty University, the world's largest evangelical Christian university, and I was in the bathroom putting gel in my hair and my friends from my dorm were all around me, giving me advice for the night, and one of them told me that the three rules of Christian dating are pay, pray, and say. You pay for the meal as the man you pray over the meal, and then you lead the conversation, or because lead doesn't rhyme, you say, the conversation. And I was freaking out because frankly, I'm not very good at going on dates, but I was also freaking out because this was the first time that I was going to have to lie to her. We all tell lies on dates. I've told girls that I like going out dancing, that I cook on my own, that I didn't watch the royal wedding. But this was different because this time, I was lying about who I was, and why I was there at Liberty University. To back up, I didn't grow up in a Christian family. I'm not an evangelical Christian. I grew up as far away from that as possible. My parents were dyed in the wool liberals who worked for Ralph Nader in the 1970s. And that was the conservative wing. I had other family members who actually on game night would play class struggle, which is the socialist alternative to monopoly. The box, if you're curious, features Nelson Rockefeller arm wrestling Karl Marx. It's a great game. And then I went to Brown University, which most evangelical Christians consider Cuba with diplomas. But in the middle of my time at Brown, I was down in Lynchburg, Virginia, with my boss working on a writing project. And I met a group of students from Liberty University. And I remember them telling me about their school. They told me it was the world's largest evangelical university. It had this set of sort of crazy rules called the Liberty Way, that said, no drinking, no smoking, no dancing, no R-rated movies, and perplexingly no hugs that lasted for longer than three seconds. This is actually a rule there. And they told me that they had classes in things like creationist biology and evangelism 101 that all the students were required to take. And I was fascinated and a little bit scared. I went back to Brown feeling like this was the most foreign place I could imagine much more foreign than Tokyo or Rio or places like that. And this was also coincidentally the time in my college career when all my friends were starting to plan their study of broads. And so I thought to myself, well, what if I went abroad to Lynchburg, Virginia, and studied this culture of conservative Christianity and found out the worst things they do, how big it is, and intolerant they are, and then wrote a book about it. And so midway through my sophomore year, I withdrew from Brown, I shipped off to Lynchburg, Virginia, and I entered Liberty University as a student and an undercover writer. I was going to write a book about my time there. And I arrived on campus, and I remember feeling the biggest culture shock of my life. These were students that had seemingly nothing in common with me. They didn't curse. They sort of like talked like Kenneth the Page, like, you know, Golly and G Wiz. They honestly believed the Earth was 6,000 years old. And they had Facebook groups like, I hope the rapture comes before my student loans were due. Which is pretty good, I thought, not bad considering the genre. And so I started to settle in, and on my first Friday night there, I went to Bible study because what else are you going to do? On a Friday night at Christian College. So I was at the house of an older student off campus. I remember going upstairs after the Bible study and watching a guy and a girl sort of kneeling together and praying very intensely. And the guy is sort of holding the girl's hand and sort of staring into her eyes. And I sort of looked around the room like, is anyone seeing this? And a girl came over to me and she introduced herself as Kristen. She was sort of like, she looked like a young Tina Fey. She had glasses and long brown hair. And she acted like one, too. She was a little cynical. And the first thing she said to me was, they're fellow shipping. That's Liberty speak for hitting on each other awkwardly. And I liked her immediately. And so we started spending more time together after that Bible study group. And we went on a few dates. And since you can't do anything on dates, since there's no physicality allowed, we had to actually talk to each other and get to know each other. And over the over time I learned that she was not very typical for Liberty. She was an evangelical Christian, sure. And she was pretty pure sort of morally. But she read Harry Potter. She liked the Beatles. Her parents had made her come to Christian school. And so through all of this, I found that I had found one person who might even a little bit be able to get me. And of course, I couldn't out myself to her. But as we went on more and more and more dates, I started telling her things about myself. I started talking about my family and my upbringing and my thoughts about some of Liberty's sort of more conservative doctrines. And it really sort of became an outlet for me as I was sort of struggling with the rest of this school. And at one point, I even was grilling her so hard that she sort of stopped and looked at me quizzically and said, are you recording this? And I knew at that point that I had gotten a little bit too close. As a semester went on, I sort of experimented in every facet of Liberty's student life. I joined the church choir. I played on the Intermural Softball team. I made friends in my dorm. And as all this sort of happened, I felt myself sort of becoming unmoored a little bit. I felt a little bit detached from the person that I'd come in being. I was sort of, I felt like I was almost being brainwashed. And so I remember, you know, sitting and typing emails to my family and friends back home and puzzling for hours about whether I should use they or we. And I knew it was bad when a friend from home sent me a Wikipedia article about Stockholm syndrome. So my family and friends were not too thrilled about this. But the one thing that I had the hardest time sort of figuring out was what to do about Kristen because on one hand, I really liked her. On the other hand, I was an undercover journalist and I couldn't exactly in good conscience continue dating her. And I realized that in some ways, you know, dating is about what you tell people, but relationships are different. They're about sort of what you don't leave out. And so I knew that even though I had fun dating her, I couldn't really be in a relationship with her. And so midway through this semester, I called her and I said, you know, I just, I'm really busy lately. You know, I've got a lot going on. I don't know if I can make it out to our date this weekend. I sort of blew her off, frankly, and it killed me to do that. And I remember telling her, you know, like, it's not you, it's me. And for the first time in the history of that phrase, it was not a lie. And so the semester went on and I would see Kristen around the school, but I didn't talk to her as nearly as frequently. And the semester went on and I had sort of wild and great experiences. Some of what I saw there was awful. It was classes about creationism and the homosexual agenda and Jerry Falwell was the chancellor of this school. And Falwell who said that 9-11 was, you know, the fault of Gays and Lesbians and the ACLU or as I like to call them, you know, my friends and family. So this was not a totally comfortable experience, but it was a productive one. And I came away from the semester, sort of feeling more virtuous. And I never converted, but I felt the sort of Christianity rubbing off on me. And I remember coming back to New York and I was at the Apple store and I had a broken laptop that I had dropped. And I went to the guy at the Genius Bar and he said, you know, don't tell anyone, but if you say that you didn't drop this, that it just broke, I can save you $400 in repair fees. And I remember sort of sitting there tearing my hair out. Like, God is going to judge me if I do this. You know, I can't in good conscience. And I know like, you know, this is not on any Christian virtue scale. Like it doesn't register. I know Steve Jobs is not like widows and orphans. But I still felt more virtuous than I had before I got there. Except for one thing, I still hadn't told my friends there that there was this book coming out and that they were going to be in it. And so six months passed and I went back down to Liberty. The book hadn't come out yet and I sort of gathered them one by one and told them that I was there in essence to sort of catalog their lives and our lives and then I was turning them into the characters of a book. And they forgave me. I mean, because you know, like forgiveness is Christian crack or what, you know, it's like, but so they weren't mad. They were a little confused and they felt that they had actually not done their job by not converting me. So they apologized to me. They were like, we're so sorry that we didn't show you the way to God. Clearly we screwed something up. And on that trip, I learned that Christian had actually left Liberty. She had transferred to a home close to where she lived and wasn't going there anymore. And I guess she felt sort of mismatched there too. So there was one more person left to call before this book came out and I called her and I sort of caught up a little bit and I told her that there was this book and she was going to be in it. And she sort of paused and then she paused some more and then she said, oh, so that's why you didn't know anything. She said, that's why you called it Philippians instead of Philippians and that. She was everything sort of clicked into place. And the second thing that she said was that she was glad that it actually wasn't her, that she hadn't done anything wrong. And so after that call, we sort of fell out of touch. We both sort of in and out of other relationships. The book came out and out of all the questions I got about the book as I was going around telling this story. And 90% of the time people would ask, what happened to Kristen? And I had changed your name, I should mention that by that point. But people would ask, they wanted to know, had we ended up together? Had we, you know, had there been a happy ending to our story? And you know, I couldn't exactly tell them what they wanted to hear. But I said, yeah, we're still in touch. And then more and more time passed and I felt the categories becoming clearer in my life. I knew that I was not a Liberty student. I was not an evangelical Christian. My life sort of became much more like what it was before I did this experiment. But I couldn't sort of shake the one thing that she had said to me, which was that, you weren't just sort of using me for material for your book, where she said, you know, we, that was not your point in all this. And I had responded, no, of course. But I thought about that more and more and so years after the book came out just a little while ago. I gave her a call and we talked and caught up again and talked about the things in our lives that had been going on. And I said, you know, people ask about you. When I go out on the road and talk and tell this story, they want to know what happened to you, what happened to us. And she said, well, that, you know, that makes sense because we were pretty amazing. And she sort of chuckled. And I just sat there and smiled because I realized that for the first time since I had left liberty in that statement, I had found a we that felt real to me. Thank you."
14,jugglingandjesus.wav," Do you remember the first moment that the approval of your peers mattered more than the approval of your parents? I know that it hadn't happened yet when I was in fifth grade because as fifth graders we were the undisputed kings of Francis Stevens Elementary School and there was no questioning our choices. You could have told me Colin, it's not cool to wear the same pair of sweatpants every single day of school but I was comfortable. You could have told me Colin, it's not cool to go to the school dance and do the macarena for the entire duration of Guns n' Roses November rain. I would not have stopped. You could have told me Colin, it's not cool to be an active member of your local church's clown troop. Alright, I knew that one wasn't cool. Fifth grade was the last year I can remember believing that the world needed more of two things, juggling and Jesus. Yeah, you can laugh. That's the most fun way to describe being raised fundamentalist. I'm better now. It's fine, thank you. And then I went to sixth grade, I went to middle school and all of a sudden to survive. It was clear there were only two options. I could somehow be cool or I could somehow be invisible. And I got to say I was doing pretty well at option two until third period on the first day of school. When a teacher had us fill out a questionnaire with a series of get to know you questions and I assumed that she would be reading them privately. So I felt safe to share from the perspective of a sweatpants wearing macarena dancing Christian clowning little snowflake that I was. The teacher collected the sheets, shuffled them up and then redistributed them to the class where we went one by one and read the student's name and then we would read our three favorite answers that they gave. My sheet ended up in the hands of a kid. I don't remember his name but he was one of the coolest and meanest kids I'd ever met. And by coincidence his three favorite answers were the three worst possible questions I could have had read out loud in front of my peers. The first question was what is your favorite movie and the other kids had said scream, universal soldier and I remember thinking we're 11. How are you seeing our rated movies? My answer was Beauty and the Beast. Which I maintain has held up better than those other two movies but I could not make that argument effectively at the time. And this laugh erupted from the room and I felt my cheeks burn because I knew we were just getting started. The next question he chose to read was where would you like to travel and the other kids had said Australia, Japan, Paris and I said wherever a book takes me. I can hear in some of you a sort of maternal instinct kick in and I could have used you on that day because the laughter this time had an explosive quality to it. The kids were high-fiving in front of my face. The final question this kid chose to read was what do you like to do on the weekends? Do the kids that said hang out with friends, go to the mall where I'm assuming they were sneaking into our rated movies? My answer was performing with clowns for Christ. Loved to pull that one back. If I could. Those who weren't laughing at me were sort of staring at me and disgusted this point. Those are two very intense things together. I agree. That's a lot to process. And I remember that I felt about an inch tall. I remember staring at my trapper keeper and trying to figure out if I could somehow disappear inside of it. And I wanted to stand up and yell out, I'd get it. I'm going to quit clowns. I'm going to watch our rated movies. I'm going to do whatever it takes to be invisible. But right then something amazing happened. A voice from the back of the room said, guys, cut it out. And the room went silent. The voice belonged to Michelle Seever. And Michelle Seever was popular and cool. Michelle Seever had sway and the room was quiet. But Michelle wasn't done. She turned to the teacher and said, why are you letting this happen? What is the point of this if we're just going to make fun of each other? And to this day, I don't remember the teacher, the class, the names of any of the kids in that class. But I remember Michelle Seever's first and last name. I remember how it felt when she spoke up for me because on that day, she showed me that we actually have three options. You can be cool. You might be remembered for a little while. You can be invisible and you won't be remembered at all. But if you stand up for somebody when they need you most, then you will be remembered as their hero for the rest of their life."
15,tetris.wav," Let's start with Tetris. In June of 1984, the computer programmer Alexei Pizzytnov was working for the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow. He was 28 years old and a bit of a puzzle nerd. To test the capabilities the computers he worked on, Pizzytnov liked to create simple games, and that month he developed a game in which the player had to fit various kinds of tetromanos together, a tetromano being a shape composed of four connected squares. Tetromanos come in seven possible configurations, and Tetris has all of them. Your job is to fit them together in a way that forms horizontal lines that can then disappear. Tetris, named for Tetromanos and Pizzytnov's favorite sport, tennis, would go on to infect the thoughts and dreams of millions of people, and also lead to a complex series of lawsuits over who owns intellectual property created by an employee of a totalitarian state that no longer exists. When Tetris came to the United States in 1989, the game's tagline was, from Russia with fun. The Berlin Wall fell that year. The Cold War was ending. The promise of freedom and democracy was toppling dictatorships throughout Eastern Europe, and the speed of all that change was truly dizzying. I was in second grade when Alexey Pizzytnov invented Tetris. My teacher still had a practice hiding under our desks in the event of a Soviet nuclear attack. Two years later, Billy Joel became the first popular American musician ever to tour the Soviet Union, and three years after that, Tetris arrived from Russia with fun. And partly due to this rapid change and instability, nobody knew exactly who owned Tetris. Pizzytnov gave the rights for distributing the game to the Soviet government, partly because he developed it for his government work, and partly because he was afraid not to. The Soviet government then formed an organization to distribute the game, but at least six different companies claimed distribution rights. It was a complete mess with courts eventually getting involved, but when it all shook out, Tetris was available in the US for the original eight-bit Nintendo entertainment system, as well as Nintendo's new handheld gaming device, the Game Boy, where I and several million other people fell in love with it. All the while, Alexey Pizzytnov received almost no money from the success of Tetris, and continued to work for the state. He developed a three-dimensional sequel to Tetris named Welteris, which was much more challenging and complex than Tetris, but also less good. Welteris came out for the Commodore 64 gaming system in 1991, with the tagline, The Soviet Challenge Continues, which ultimately proved to be untrue. The Soviet Union collapsed later that year. So Pizzytnov moved to the US, where he worked on the Nintendo game Yoshi's Cookie and various other projects, before eventually taking a full-time job at Microsoft. Although the USSR no longer existed, it still owned Tetris, so the Russian government continued to receive royalties until 1996, when the government's deal with Pizzytnov expired, and he finally began to make money off the game he'd invented 12 years earlier. By then of course, video games had moved on. 1996 saw the release of Duke Nukem and Tomb Raider, but Tetris remained enduringly popular, and there was a huge surge of sales with the emergence of gaming on smartphones. In fact, today, Tetris is the best-selling video game of all time. In its story, the creator who received no royalties until he became American and claimed his rightful intellectual property exemplifies the American dream. It's a story of immigration and capitalism and freedom of creative expression. But it is also, like any story, more complicated than that. One of Pizzytnov's collaborators, with whom he moved to the United States, eventually killed himself and his family after going broke. Pizzytnov did eventually get paid for the tremendous value he created, but most of the people who got rich off of Tetris, from Nintendo stockholders to licensing middlemen, did little if anything to make the game what it is. In short, the story of Tetris is the story of capitalism. Almost all the value that is created gets captured, but it isn't always captured by those who create it. As for the game itself, the genius of Tetris is its simplicity. Pizzytnov's original program used only 2.7 kilobytes of memory. Shapes fall out of the sky, and you try to fit them together to form horizontal lines, which then disappear. Most expert players aim to build nearly complete lines while waiting for the coveted straight long piece, which can be inserted into the missing space to erase four lines at once, a high scoring accomplishment called a Tetris. As a kid, I played Tetris on my Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy so much that I often experienced the so-called Tetris effect, first described by Jeffrey Goldsmith in Wired magazine. At night, he wrote, geometric shapes fell in the darkness. Days I sat on a lavender swade sofa and played Tetris furiously. During rare jumps from the house, I visually fit cars and trees and people together. These days, I often hear my contemporaries express bafflement that young people watch other people play video games on Twitch or YouTube. But I get it. I could watch friends play Tetris for hours. Even now, I find watching replays of the Tetris world championships literally mesmerizing. There's an extraordinary satisfaction to watching a clean stack build, a magnificent tension to waiting for the long piece, and then the thrill and relief of that long piece's eventual arrival and boom. Tetris. The line's clear and the building begins anew. Tetris is a game about time and space. Time is always speeding up with blocks falling faster and faster, and space is always filling in. There is no winning. Tetris always ends the same way no matter how expertly you place the blocks. You play until you die. It takes five minutes to learn Tetris. It's not grand or ambitious. It's merely perfect. Tetris was the first great distraction of my life, and I don't mean that as an insult. I don't know if I'm alone in this regard, but I have this omnipresent pain inside me, a constant and gnawing pain that I'm always trying to distract myself from feeling. This pain is generally kind of a minor background anguish that only occasionally gets bad enough to take over my life. But it's also never not there. It's hard for me to describe the pain without resorting to figurative language, but I think it's the pain of meaninglessness. The fear that my vast interior life will die with me, and that my brief miraculous flicker of consciousness will not have been for anything. For me at least, there's a terrifying depravity to meaninglessness. As it calls into question, not only why I write and read and garden and eat and love and everything else, but also whether I should even bother, which is a line of thinking I genuinely cannot afford to indulge. Of course, such pain must be confronted and dealt with, carefully considered and battled against. There are times for that deep engagement with the overwhelming questions. But there are also times for pure and magnificently empty distraction. Enter Tetris, which is incredibly effective at distracting me from that way down pain. And I think effective distractions are a gift to the world. Because when that background pain overwhelms me, I can't do the work of finding and building meaning in my life. Of course, distractions can become too powerful. They can begin to substitute for meaning. But I still wouldn't want to attempt consciousness without them. Like I hear good things about meditating until you achieve enlightenment. But in my particular case, there's no way I'd survive it. Tetris is as close as I'm ever going to get to Nirvana. I give Tetris four and a half stars."
16,wheretheressmoke.wav," I reached over and secretly undid my seatbelt. And when his foot hit the brake at the red light, I flung open the door and I ran. I had no shoes on, I was crying, I had no wallet, but I was okay because I had my cigarettes. And I didn't want any part of freedom if I didn't have my cigarettes. When you live with someone who has a temper, a very bad temper, a very, very bad temper, you learn to play around that. You learn this time, I'll play possum, and next time, I'll just be real nice, or I'll say yes to everything, or you make yourself scarce, or you run. And this was one of the times when you just run. And as always, running, I thought this was a great place to jump out because they were big lawns, they were cul-de-sacs, and sometimes he would come after me and drive and yell stuff at me to get back in, get back in, and I was like, no, I'm out of here. This is great, and I went and hid behind a cabana, and he left, and I had my cigarettes. And I started to walk in this beautiful neighborhood. It was 10.30 at night, and it was silent and lovely, and there was no sound except for sprinklers. Ch-ch-ch-ch, and I was enjoying myself, and enjoying the absence of anger, and enjoying these few hours I knew I'd have of freedom. And just to perfect it, I thought, I'll have a smoke, and then it occurred to me with horrifying speed. I don't have a light! Just then, as if an answer, I see a figure up ahead. Who is that? It's not him, okay? They don't have a dog, who is that? What are they doing out on this suburban street? And the person comes closer and I can see it's a woman. And then I can see, she has her hands in her face. Oh, she's crying. And then she sees me and she composes herself. And she gets closer and I see she has no shoes on. She has no shoes on and she's crying. And she's out on this street. I recognize her, though I've never met her. And just as she passes me, she says, you got a cigarette? And I say, you got a light? And she says, damn, I hope so. And then first she digs into her cut-offs in the front, nothing, and then digs in the back. And then she has this vest on. It has 50 million little pockets on it. She's checking and checking and it's looking bad. It's looking very bad. She digs back in the front again, deep, deep. And she pulls out a pack of matches that have been laundered at least once. We open it up and there is one match inside. Okay, oh my God. This takes on, it's like, nason now. We got it like, how are we going to do it? Okay, and we hunker down, we crouch on the ground, and where's the wind coming from? We're stopping. I take out my cigarettes. Let's get the cigarettes ready. Oh, my brand, she says. Not surprising. And we both have our cigarettes at the ready. She strikes once, nothing. She strikes again. Yes, fire. Puff, inhale. Sweet kiss of that cigarette. And we sit there and we're loving the nicotine. And we both need this right now. I can tell the night's been tough. Immediately we start to reminisce about our 30-second relationship. I didn't think that was going to happen. Me neither. Oh, man, that was close. Oh, I'm so lucky I saw you, yeah. Then she surprises me by saying, what was the fight about? And I say, what are they all about? And she said, I know what you mean. She said, was it a bad one? And I said, you know, like medium. She said, oh, and we start to trade stories about our lives. We're both from up north. We're both kind of new to the neighborhood. This is in Florida. We both went to college, not grade colleges, but man, we graduated. And I'm actually finding myself a little jealous of her because she has this really cool job, washing dogs. She had horses back home and she really loves animals and she wants to be a vet. And I'm like, man, you're halfway there. I'm a waitress at an ice cream parlor. So that's not, I don't know where I want to be, but I know it's not that. And then it gets a little deeper. And we share some other stuff about what our lives are like. Things that I can't ever tell people at home. This girl, I can tell her the really ugly stuff and she still understands how it can still be pretty. She understands how nice he's going to be when I get home. How sweet that'll be. We are chain smoking off each other. Oh, that's almost out. Come on, and we go through this entire pack until it's gone. And then I say, you know what? This is a little funny, but you're going to have to show me the way to get home. Because although I'm 23 years old, I don't have my driver's license yet and I just jumped out right when I needed to. And she says, well, why don't you come back to my house and I'll give you a ride. I said, OK, great. And we start walking. And we get to this lots of lights. And the roads are getting wider and wider. And there's more cars. And I see lots of stores, you know, laundry mats and dollar stores and emergency centers. Great. Then we cross over US one. And she leads me to some place that I think, no. But yes, Carl's Efficiency Apartments. This girl lives there. And it's horrible. And it's lit up so bright just to illuminate the harboring of this of it. It's the kind of place where you drive your car right up and the door's right there. And there's 50 million cigarette butts outside. And there's like doors one through seven and no behind every single door. There's some horrible misery going on. There's someone crying or drunk or lonely or cruel. And I think, oh, she lives here. How awful. We go to the door, door number four. And she very, very quietly keys in. As soon as the door opens, I hear the glare of television come out. And on the blue light of the television, the smoke of 100 cigarettes in that little crack of light. And I hear the man. And he says, where were you? And she says, never mind, I'm back. And he says, y'all right? And she says, yeah, I'm all right. And then she turns to me and says, you want a beer? And he says, who the fuck is that? And she pulls me over. And he sees me and he says, oh, hey, I'm not a threat. Just then he takes a drag of his cigarette, a very hard, hard drag, the kind that makes the end of it really heat up, hot, hot, hot. And long, and it's a little scary. And I follow the cigarette down, because I'm afraid of that head falling off. And I'm surprised when I see in the crook of his arm a little boy sleeping, a toddler. And I think, and just then the girl reaches underneath the bed and takes out a carton. And she taps out the last pack of cigarettes in there. And on the way up, she kisses a little boy. And then she kisses the man. And the man says, again, you all right? And she says, yeah, I'm just going to go out and smoke with her. And so we go outside and sit amongst the cigarette butts and smoke. And I say, wow, that's your little boy. And she says, yeah, isn't he beautiful? And I say, yeah, he is. He is beautiful. She's my light. He keeps me going. And she says, we finish our cigarettes. She finishes her beer. I don't have a beer, because I can't go home with beer on my breath. And she goes inside to get the keys. She takes too long in there getting the keys. And I think something must be wrong. And she comes out and she says, look, I'm really sorry. But we don't have any gas in the car. It's already on E. And he needs to get to work in the morning. And I'm going to walk to work as it is. So what I did was, though, here, look, I drew out this map for you. And you're really, you're like a mile and a half from home. And if you walk three streets over, you'll be back on that pretty street. And you just take that and you'll be fine. And she also has wrapped up in toilet paper, seven cigarettes for me, a third of her pack. And a new pack of matches. And she tells me, goodbye. And that was great to meet you and how lucky and that was fun. And let's be friends. And I say, yeah, OK. And I walk away. But I kind of know we're not going to be friends. I might not ever see her again. And I kind of know, I don't think she's ever going to be a vet. And I cross and I walk away. And maybe this would have seemed like a visit from my possible future and scary. But it kind of does the opposite on the walk home. I'm like, man, that was really grim over there. And I'm going home now to my nice boyfriend. And he is going to be so extra happy to see me. And we have a one bedroom apartment. And we have two trees. And there's a yard. And we have this jar in the kitchen where there's like loose money that we can use for anything. We would never, ever run out of gas. And I don't have a baby. So I can leave whenever I want. I smoked all seven cigarettes on the way home. And people who have never smoked cigarettes just think, ik, disgusting and poison. But unless you've had them and held them dear, you don't know how great they can be and what friends and comfort and kinship they can bring. It took me a long time to quit that boyfriend. And then to quit smoking. And sometimes I still miss the smoking. I'm really pleased with your outlook on how to include Husband and no Golden laying."
17,comingofageondeathrow.wav," When I was 15, there were two things that made up a good day. The first was chocolate chip waffles for breakfast. And the second was a chest tournament after school. I was a good, if apathetic student. I had a pension for bad puns. I was kind of nerdy and awkward. Were these baggy shirts in my mom bought me. And I had this long, shaggy hair that kind of made me look like an Indian Anakin Skywalker. You can imagine that. It wasn't a good look. But yeah, that was me at 15. And I was 15 when I got involved with the most well-known death row in American history. It started when a friend of mine gave me a ring and told me about this man named Troy Davis. He told me Davis was convicted in 1991 of murdering a police officer. And there was no physical evidence. No gun, no DNA. So instead, this conviction was based on nine eyewitness testimonies. But in the years since the trial, seven of those nine came forward and said they lied at the trial because they had been intimidated or coerced by the police in the saying Troy Davis shot the police officer. And now Davis was trying to go to a court, any court, to present this new evidence, but none of them would even give him a hearing. Now, I had this blind faith in the justice system. And this just seemed too evil to be true. I didn't want to believe it. But there was one small detail I couldn't get out of my head. And it was the fact that the state of Georgia, my home state, was due to execute Troy Davis six days before the US Supreme Court was supposed to review the case. And at this point, in 2008, Troy Davis had been on death row for 17 years. So why couldn't they wait one more week for the highest court in the country to review the case? Something was wrong. And for the first time in my life, I started following the news really closely. And when the Supreme Court 90 minutes before the execution stepped in to stop it, so they could review the case, for the first time ever, I wanted to write a letter, a physical letter. I didn't really know how to write one. My dad had to help me put the stamp on the right part of the envelope. I accidentally switched it to and the from, put them in the wrong place. But I wanted to write him a letter just so he knew that there was someone out there who cared that there was something so obviously wrong with this case. But when that same week I found out that not only did Troy read my letter, but he wanted me to come visit him on death row, I was conflicted. I didn't want to go. I was scared. He was 39 and I was 15. He was black, I was brown. He grew up in a poor neighborhood full of drugs and gangs. And I grew up in an affluent suburb full of manicured lawns and overpriced coffee shops. And he was a convicted cop killer. I was the president of chess club. But he could face another execution date in a matter of days. How could I say no to him? It reminded me when my dad and I would walk through downtown Atlanta and homeless people would ask us for money. My dad would just avoid eye contact and walk right through them or he'd lie and say he didn't have any money to give. They'll probably just spend it on drugs, he said. So I followed suit and walked right through. But it felt wrong not to help someone nearby when they were in need. And now Troy Davis was less than a hundred miles away from where I was standing. He was about to be executed for a crime he didn't commit. I couldn't walk right through again. So I decided to visit him on death row. And I was too young to drive. So my mom got behind the driver's seat and we made the two hour drive down to Georgia's death row. During which she insisted on feeding me her signature cucumber and mayonnaise sandwiches. And I'm sorry mom but that's a gross combination. And I don't know why I didn't say anything then about it but I shouldn't have eaten those. When we got to death row we had to check in and if Troy hadn't submitted our names for approval while in advance we wouldn't have gotten in. You go through security and they take our wallets and keys and IDs. Then you walk through this or well in hall of motivational posters to say things like integrity, courage, justice. And then you go up a flight of stairs to this lobby. And on the left side of the lobby is this row of bending machines which will rapidly deplete the 80 quarters we bring because when an inmate has visitors the prison refuses to feed them so we have to replace Troy's lunch. The death row inmates are kept three at a time in these cages that they call special visitation cells. And I tell one of the guards I'm here to see Troy Davis. And so he motions me over to one of the cells on Locksador, Usher's me in and then locks it again from the outside. Now here I am 15 years old on death row in a cage with three convicted murderers and the only guards on the other side of that Locks door. But the first thing I noticed about Troy was just how warm he was. As soon as he saw me his face split into a wide grin and he said, wow you're tall in his deep savanna draw. And then he motioned for me to sit next to him and thanks me for my letter which he said was now taped on the wall of his cell. And then he told me his side of the story about the night the police officer was killed about how he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. How he didn't even have a gun that night. And once he was arrested the media before he was even convicted before his trial had to erase his identity as Troy Davis and given him a new one, cop killer. And he was forced to deal with the realities of being a black man in Georgia and South George in the 1980s accused of killing a white cop. When her time was up Troy hugged me and said, I'll see you again real soon. Fast forward three years and Troy Davis is now the face of a worldwide movement. A million people sign petitions trying to get his execution halted. Talking heads on CNN discuss his case every day. Kim Kardashian and Alec Baldwin tweeted about him. And so did three Nobel Peace Prize winners. There were rallies in every major American city and most major European ones, even one in Lagos, Nigeria. And I always try to remind Troy about these events so he never forget that there were people on the outside fighting for him. By this time Troy started signing his letters as Uncle Troy and he called me his adopted nephew. He'd asked me about my grades and remind me to study for tests. And he was more excited about my SAT scores and my own parents were. And he taught me dance moves from my senior proms since he was a really good dancer and I wasn't and he then made fun of me for how awkward I was around girls. And a lot of times we talk about what he would do once he got out. He said on the first night he was going to do two things. He would take a hot bath which he hadn't done since 1989. And second he was sleep with the foot of his mother's bed. So when she woke up she would know this wasn't a dream and that her son had finally come home for real. And he said longer term he wanted to speak to kids in schools especially troubled kids and show them how his faith had given him the strength to persevere two decades on death of real and so if he could do that they could do anything they put their minds to. And he promised he'd take me fishing since I'd never been and so in exchange I promised I'd teach him how to use a computer and how to use Facebook. And Troy was always convinced that he was going to be set free and that's why for all four of his execution dates he refused his last meal because to him it wasn't going to be his last meal. That fourth execution date was September 21st 2011. I just started my freshman year of college. It was a Wednesday I just finished my first college exam and then I hopped in my little red Chevy to make the drive down to the prison grounds to join the protests where thousands of people were. And my family was there too my younger sister and both my parents and they'd been divorced for nearly a decade but we all came together at night because we all loved Troy. At seven o'clock in the moment of execution the crowd fell silent and I just stared out into the sunset wondering if they were injecting Uncle Troy with poison right now. Two minutes later the crowd erupted in a roar. The Supreme Court had just issued a one day stay of execution so they could release, they could review the case one last time. And Troy had pulled off yet another miracle because in all four execution dates he had managed to somehow pull off something like this. So I drove back to my dorm making a mental promise to Troy that I'd be back the next day. And I was hanging out with some friends trying to unwind from the night when I felt my phone buzz in my pocket. I pulled it out and flipped it open because this is the time when I had a flip phone. And it was a text message from a friend and I just said, goph him. I'm so sorry. And that's when I learned that the one day stay of execution was a lie. I don't know if it was an intentional lie or just misinformation but the truth was that the Supreme Court had just delayed it for a few hours so they could release a one word, one sentence, 23 word statement saying that they would not intervene. And so Troy Davis would be executed tonight now. And instead of being out there on the prison grounds with him I was now hunched over on the couch in my dorm lobby. In my blue I am Troy Davis shirt watching Anderson Cooper on CNN count down and then finally announced that the state of Georgia had executed Troy Davis. And I felt like I'd abandoned him because even while he was being strapped to the gurney he wouldn't have known that I wasn't out there on those prison grounds but I did. I knew I wasn't there. I was here. In Aquainance walks in and she sees my shirt and the announcement on TV and asks, what do you think of all this Troy Davis stuff? But I couldn't say anything to her. Not a word. Not to her or to the people I pass in the two flights of stairs back to my room. Not to my roommate that day or the next. And not to myself as I drift off into a numb sleep knowing deep down that this wasn't justice. This was a murder. The next day there was an envelope waiting for me in my mailbox. Before I looked at the sender I knew who it was from. I'd seen that broad looped script too many times not to know which hand had written it. The day after he was executed I received the last letter I would ever get from Troy Davis. I try to keep Troy's story alive so people don't forget the truth of who he was or what really happened. And I fight to end the death penalty to honor the final request Troy made moments before he was executed that his supporters go out and fight for the other Troy Davis is there. I was 15 when I first met Troy. 18 when he was executed and I'm 23 now and I find myself missing the conversations that we never had and the questions I never asked him. But I always remember the final words Troy wrote in that final letter when he said remember that even in the worst of times God will open a door to hope and a window to prosperity. Thank you."
18,learninghumanityfromdogs.wav," I came home from work on a rainy November afternoon, more than a decade ago, to find a 20-foot U-Haul truck in my driveway and behind it, a police car. My first thought was fast, clear, instinctive. Are we being evicted? I had lived in the little rental home in Middlebury Vermont with my wife for much of the previous year. It hadn't been an easy year. We fought constantly, the fights escalating into ugly confrontations, and the confrontations lasting long into the night. But that morning, I'd left the house suspecting nothing. I was certainly unprepared for the scene that I would encounter later that day. The wooden headboard of my bed bobbing through the front door, cradled in the arms of my father-in-law. What's going on? I asked, what are you doing? He didn't even look at me as he walked toward the truck. Sir, the police officer said something very close, we're going to need you to step away from the residents. It would be another nine years before I stopped drinking. So on that night, the night my wife left me, I blamed everyone and everything except myself. I fled the house with its two sad moving van, police and father-in-law combo, and went directly to the nearest bar where I told everyone my story while downing pint after pint of tepid $2 Budweiser. I was not apologetic. I was not ashamed. I barely remember stumbling back home. What I do remember is what I found when I got there, waiting for me at the door, hungry and bewildered. We're Glasgow and seismic. Our two St. Bernard dogs. In an overturned cardboard box just inside the threshold, I found a letter. My wife explained that she couldn't take the dogs with her. She would be moving into her parents' house while she got her life back in order and there wasn't room for 250 pound animals. Even so, she was hopeful that I would fulfill my obligations to her and to our pets as a caretaker. The dogs looked at me. I looked at them. We began our new lives together. That first night I went upstairs to what had been our bedroom and not knowing what else to do. I turned out the lights and lay down on the floor. The dogs followed. They lay down as well. One on each side of me. Glasgow, the four-year-old female, we'd raised since she was a puppy, situated herself behind my back. seismic. The male we had adopted from the Humane Society at Chittenden County, cuddled into the curl of my arm. He's stuck. Then again, I didn't smell much better. In an empty house, everything is louder. It seems like a small detail, but it was transformative. I'd rented the home for nearly a year and suddenly it was completely foreign and disorienting. Every morning I woke up with two giant animals nuzzling me, panting in my face, demanding to be walked. I would walk them and upon my return I'd check the phone, hoping I'd somehow missed my wife's call saying that she had changed her mind and was moving back. She never did. I tried to carry on. I bought groceries. Said hello to the neighbors. I can see now that I was in shock, pretending everything would be okay. The house deteriorated. The laundry hamper overflowed. Bags of trash clustered in the kitchen. My bed was a sleeping bag. Dog hair accumulated in giant clumps in the corner of rooms and filthy patches in the rug. I was commuting an hour each way for work and unmoored from my previous life couldn't manage my responsibilities. I arranged for a dog sitter. You just moving in? She asked, surveying the near empty house. No. I said unable to tell the truth. Just, you know, minimalist living. One day, I had to leave earlier than usual for work. I called the dog sitter and told her I'd put the key under the mat. But she never showed. That night, I returned to find the foyer soaked with urine. The next week, I got a call at the gym. The dogs had broken out and were tearing through the trash at the deli down the street, eating chicken salad and stale baked goods. A neighbor had recognized them. I drove home, terrified that they would be taken away, that I would return to find them gone, a police car out front once again, and a trail of hair balls floating into the yard. For their part, glass-go-and-size, Mac, we're always glad to see me, always confident I would be bringing dog food or a cheese pizza, providing a walk or giving them a bath. They believed in me. When no one else did, not even myself. I think I kept them for so long in that chaos because I couldn't bear to stop loving them. I couldn't bear for them to stop loving me. But the truth was, I couldn't care for them, not in the way they needed. In May, I heard a rumor that a family outside of town was looking for two big dogs to adopt. I drove by their farm and saw a mile of white fencing, a neat and tidy flower bed, a freshly painted mailbox. I kept their phone number in my wallet for a week before I called it. It was another week before I didn't hang up when someone answered. The family and I arranged to meet on a warm summer evening in June. I put the dogs in my black Chevy Blazer, along with their chew toys, dog beds, and food dishes. Glasgow, as always, was excited to get in the car. She loved to sit in the passenger's seat. I cracked the window for her and she would press her nose into the small open space and start drooling, leaving ropes of dried saliva along the glass. That day, I reached over and scratched her ears. I was crying as I drove, crying as we pulled into the parking lot of the Grand Union. The new family was there and their Ford F-250 pick up. A man got out and walked toward me. I opened the back hatch of the Blazer. These are the dogs, I said. I nodded. Please take good care of them, I said, my voice cracking. Losing my wife had been sudden, a blow that struck with immediacy and power. The loss of the dogs, however, had an event horizon. I approached it gradually and then I was beyond it. The pressure of time, drawing me in a scapely forward and down. I'm that evening at the Grand Union. I remember shepherding seismic who didn't hesitate into the back of the other truck. Glasgow took more coaxing. Her hips had become bulky and she'd started moving more slowly. I think that she understood at least some part of what was going on. Finally, they were both in the other vehicle. I hugged them, inhaling their sin, holding Glasgow especially close one last time. I left Vermont when the divorce was complete. It was nothing to move, just myself. I thought everything would be different when I got out of that house, when the legal issues were settled, when I had a new job, when I stopped expecting my former wife to call. I didn't drive by the farm after I surrendered seismic in Glasgow. I didn't visit. What if they thought I was there to take them home? It was not until I got sober and had children of my home that I felt again that awesome responsibility. The complete trust that another being places in you. The faith that you will bring the pizza and take the walks and provide the warm baths, that you will be the one who guides, who tens, who listens. Glasgow and seismic are dead now. They would be twice the usual lifespan or more of a St. Bernard. But they were, in a way, my first children. They taught me how to be human, or how to be a better human, to put someone else's needs before my own. Or maybe it was my first wife who taught me this when she decided to leave me with two dogs in an empty house. Not long ago, as I sat alone at home one night, my daughter cried out in her bedroom. She was having a nightmare. I went up by the time I reached her. She'd fallen back asleep. I lay down next to her anyway, in her small bed and kiss the back of her head, brush the hair out of her face. Then I set a small prayer of thanks and gratitude for this role, for this opportunity to care."
19,shoppinginchina.wav," Over the years, I've had a number of parenting theories in the hopes of achieving my parenting goals. These theories are not based on data, and I frequently abandoned both my theories and my goals. But the one goal I was dedicated to was that my two sons would grow up to be individuals who were comfortable and confident in new situations. My obsession with this goal is simple. I am rarely comfortable or confident in new situations. In fact, if it were up to me, I would never go anywhere new, and I would not meet new people. But as a college professor, it's rarely up to me, and I go new places, and I meet new people all the time. And I secretly dread every minute of it. I'm good at what I do, but I have to force myself to do these things. And my goal for my boys is that they would grow up to be people who welcomed new experiences and didn't secretly dread every minute of it. So the working theory was that I could create confident, new experience seeking adults by modeling confident behavior, even though I wasn't actually confident myself. I had their entire childhoods to test this hypothesis. So I started by moving my family to China. When the boys were five and eight years old, I figured if I could fake confidence, traveling to and living in a foreign country that bore no resemblance to our life back in the states, I would have succeeded. So the key to faking confidence is planning, leaving nothing up to chance. So I plan, and I check my plans, and I recheck my plans, until I drive everyone around me crazy. And I knew a move to China would require the highest level of planning I had ever attempted. So my two sons and my husband and I flew from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Beijing, and then on to Chengdu, China, where we would be living. And as I got off the plane, I immediately was aware that nothing was familiar. Not the sights, not the sounds, not the smells. So far, mission accomplished. So we settled into Chengdu, and I found I was very content to be picked up every morning by a driver, driven to my teaching assignment, and then delivered back to our apartment in the afternoon. I was very comfortable teaching. But when I would get back to the apartment, my boys were ready for a new adventure in their new city. And on the weekends, these adventures often included trips to the art market. Now back in the states, I only shop for food, because you have to shop for food. I don't shop for other things like gifts and clothes, because that usually means going somewhere new and having to interact with new people. The beauty of grocery stores is the people who work there don't care what you buy, and they leave you alone. So I don't enjoy grocery shopping, but I am very, very good at it, if you judge success by time in the store. I've made my boys very efficient shoppers. We only go to one grocery store, and we know where everything is. I actually time myself when I grocery shop. It's as if I'm working towards some sort of qualifying trials for the grocery store Olympics. But it was clear that in China, we would be shopping for things other than food. And the art market became the place, our go-to place for doing this. The first time we went to the art market, I quickly realized that very little English was spoken there, and our Mandarin is not what it should be. I was immediately overwhelmed by the bargaining that was going on, and the vendors calling to us trying to get us to buy all things Chinese. These are situations I dread, all the noise and commotion, and I alternate between wanting to scream to just make it all stop or wanting to run from the noise. These are not good options if you're trying to model confident behavior. So on that first visit to the art market, when I really thought I couldn't tolerate anymore, a man appeared out of nowhere. He was ageless, but clearly old, and his English was impeccable. And he quickly integrated himself into our shopping that day, giving us advice and helping us negotiate. He would become our shopping guide for our art market excursions, guiding our purchases and being reimbursed by the vendors. And just as he would appear out of nowhere when we arrived at the art market, he seemed to disappear the same way, giving my boys the sense that he was magical. I thought he was magical as well, because unwittingly he'd become part of my plan. Not only did he make shopping tolerable, he made me look like a confident shopper in a foreign country. So it turned out, well, we were in China, my husband would have a birthday, and my husband was born in the year of the rooster. So what better, more culturally appropriate gift than a statue of a rooster to celebrate his birth year. So I waited for a day when he was busy, so the boys and I could go on an art market shopping adventure. By now I had a zone of comfort in Chengdu, to work in back with a driver, to the grocery store and back with a card that said very specifically in Mandarin where I was going, and to the art market because of our shopping guide. So as we left that morning, the boys did not realize that we were looking for a gift for their dad. They just knew that we were looking for a statue of a rooster. Young children are not good at keeping secrets related to surprises. They just don't get the timing of when you should tell the secret. So my solution to this was to tell them that we were never going to tell their dad about this trip. And I really emphasized that he could never know. So as the boys and I left, we fully expected to see our shopping guide when we got to the art market, and honestly, I wouldn't have attempted the outing otherwise, but he was nowhere in sight. I had no way of contacting him, so this was not something I could plan. And my first reaction was to turn around and head back to the apartment. But I stopped myself. I could do this, and the boys were my motivation. After all, the vendors had always been very kind to use whatever English that they knew to help us with our purchases. We were only looking for a statue of a rooster. How hard could that be? So the art market is outdoors, and it's organized in long rows of open-air stalls. I brace myself, and I approached a likely vendor. And I saw that he had a chart of all the animals of the Chinese years. And suddenly, I felt very confident. I would point at a rooster, and then I would show with my hands that I wanted to stretch you over rooster and not a picture. And I did this fully aware that my boys were witnessing my incredibly calm approach at bridging this communication gap. And the vendor watched me, and the next thing I heard was, no cock for you. And then, without taking a breath, he yelled down the long row of stalls, the white lady needs a cock who has a cock for her. Needless to say, I hadn't planned on this. And suddenly, I was surrounded by well-meaning men holding various size statues of roosters all calling to me. I have a better cock. I have a cheaper cock. But the focus seems to be on the size of the cock that I want. With lots of calls of you want big cock or little cock. I am now awake in my worst nightmare. And the nightmare is not being bombarded by this word or having the boys exposed to it. And the nightmare isn't even the noise in commotion. The nightmare is that the boys are witnessing me panic and completely lose control of this situation. I feel like I'm literally drowning and pulling them with me. It would have been hard to model less confident behavior as I grab their hands announcing I don't like any of the cocks and bolted from the art market. On the ride back to the apartment, I wondered what I could possibly say to lessen the impact of this fiasco. But I stayed silent. I'm originally from New England and this is a common strategy. We pretend something hasn't happened by not talking about it. So we got to the apartment and my husband had already returned and he greeted us with, I didn't expect you back so soon. Evidently this can't go unanswered. So my younger boy says, mom was looking for a cock but couldn't find one she liked. Always a fan of new words, he's adopted this vocabulary. This is followed by his older brother, admonishing him saying, you weren't supposed to say anything mom said to never tell. At this point my husband and I are both laughing. I'm laughing because the trauma of this event has been lost on the boys. The only thing they've taken away is that I'm a discerning shopper and would not settle for the wrong item. You never know what you're modeling for your kids. I'd like to tell you the back in the states that I'm more confident but I continue to be uncomfortable in a variety of everyday situations and I continue to cope with this by overplanning. When my older boy was ready for high school this included insisting that we take the public bus and practice getting to his building and when I offered to write it all down for him he turned and said, I found my way around Beijing on the subway. I'm pretty sure I can find my high school. And I smiled because after all that had been the goal all along. Thank you."
20,gangstersandcookies.wav," I'm standing in line at McDonald's and I really want those chocolate chip cookies. I have like $2.39 in my pocket and just as I'm about to order the cookies, I see them in flurries. So I'm like, oh crap, now I want to make flurry. I end up buying it, but I still wanted the cookies and I'm still online. So I call out to my friends sitting at a table near the cashier. Guys, do you have a dollar? They say no. Then about four people behind me, I hear, oh, I got a dollar and I turn around and see this tall, dark, and handsome young man walk up to the front of the line. He gives me a dollar. I happily bought my cookies and sit with my friends. Now he and his boys are two tables away and they're all telling jokes and me and my friends are all laughing at them. One of his boys decides to come over and talk to one of my girlfriends. And then he walks over to me, stuffing my face with chocolate chip cookies and says, I see you put my dollar to good use. I laughed. And that was the day I began my friendship with Samuel Jenkins. After that day in 2008, Samuel and I became really good friends. I like hanging out with him because he's a good conversationalist and I'm a good listener. He's also extremely hilarious and I'm extremely sarcastic. So we have a lot of fun. He also never tried to flirt with me or hook me up with any of his boys. So that was a plus. And he was a very, very good friend to me. And I'm the type of person, you know, as a girl, I believe that a guy and a girl can be just friends, you know, no kissing, no flirting, no sexual activity. And Samuel was it for me. So I really enjoyed being around him. One weird thing that I did notice about Samuel was how he dressed. And he'd wear these bold red and blue hoodies and sometimes green fitheads. And if some of you don't know, these colors are associated with gangs. And if you wore these colors and you weren't a member or associated, that meant trouble for you or that made you an easy target. Like the kids at my school who had been getting cut and robbed and jumped. And there's this day called Blood Initiation Day where basically members of the blood gang go around slicing girls' faces. So I told Samuel about this and he opted in to pick me up after school and then take me home. I walk outside and I see him waiting for me and he's wearing a red hoodie. And as I'm walking to him, I'm thinking, what is he wearing? So I go up to him, look him up and down and tell him, semi jokingly. Boy, you gotta start wearing these colors because I'm not trying to get shot with you. His response was, now we good. At that point, I questioned whether he was in a gang or not, but I shrugged it off because we got home safely until he finally asked me, yeah, because you know I'm in a gang, right? There was a long moment of silence and I just stared at him. And I didn't want to believe him because he didn't know my serious near death experiences with multiple gang members. He didn't know that I hated gangs because I feel that they're pointless organizations created by people who victimize others and claim power because they put the fear into people and that means respect. But there's a difference between being feared and being respected. You live longer when you're respected. So as his friend, I made it my job to keep him alive and persuade him out of this nonsense. Initially, I was upset with him and more disappointed, but we were already friends and I wasn't ready to call him out of my life. So our fun conversations about past blind dates and stealing through from bodegas and we were younger, changed it to him sharing his stories with me about how he got in a gentleman rush from firing his gun at a group of boys who messed with one of his fellow gang members and how he robbed this kid for a zoom because he looked at him funny. I would argue with him about how ignorant he sounded and pleaded with him. Samuel, had I known from the beginning that you were in a gang, we would not be sitting here right now. I don't understand how someone as intelligent and generous as you can enjoy being in a gang. He just sat there with his head down and he only apologized for not telling me earlier. And I kind of feel sorry for him. So I changed the conversation. Summer of that year, 2009, we decided to go to the pool together and as I'm waiting for him, we're laughing and reminiscing about how funny they should go on. Tyrone Bingham's crack intervention was. And out of nowhere, he says, you know, I was going to recruit you, right? I wasn't finished laughing, but I just stopped. I've never been so furious, so fast in my life before. It was as if my heart was a volcano and it exploded and all the lava shots straight up to my head. And it was more of a physical anger, not an expressive one where I curse a mile or punch him in the face. And he saw that I was at a loss of words. So he continued trying to cover it up saying, but I didn't because I got mad respect for you. You're like assisted in me and I don't really trust girls, but you're one of the three that I do trust. All I could think about was, I am so cutting this dude off. This friendship is over. And I wanted to leave, but we didn't. And I spent that whole day very upset. And I hadn't spoken to him a week after that day. I didn't even miss him. He texted me twice and I never replied. And then he called and I picked up with the intention of cursing him out, telling him to go to hell and then hanging up the phone. But he kept apologizing over and over and kept talking about how I was like a sister to him like fam. Eventually I forgave him, but we hadn't called each other like we used to. We hadn't hung out like we used to. And then we just stopped communicating with each other. I graduated and my friends decided to go to McDonald's. McDonald's is basically the spot for us. It was our lives. And we were sitting there talking, oh, I'm going to miss you. This is going to be our last year together. And one of my friends asked, the boy, what happened to that boy? I'm like, what boy? My other friend says, your boyfriend. I'm like, boy, boyfriend. And then they both say, the boy that bought you the cookies. And I was just like, first of all, he's not my boyfriend. Second of all, he gave me a dollar. I bought the cookies. So after that, I couldn't stop thinking about him. So I was just thinking, well, it wouldn't hurt to text him. But then I realized that after you haven't spoken to someone in over a year and you text them, it's kind of like, who are you? So I decided to call him. And when I spoke to him, he sounded really good over the phone, really mature. And he told me that he left the city and he was in Pennsylvania working at a wood and bat factory. He told me, I got to get out of the city. I'm tired of the city life. I need a break. So I'm going to be here for a while. And when he told me that, I just thought, wow, I miss him a lot now. But I'm proud of his attempt to change his life. And I feel like I have something to do with that. And the feeling was mutual because he also changed me. And I'm more of an understanding person. It's easier to judge someone than understand them. And that was hard for me to do in the beginning. So instead of judging him as a gang member, I understood him as a friend and as someone who felt that he was born into a gang. And I felt the need to change that. So now with my friends, they're openly telling me their stories. And I'm saying, okay, I understand. But here's the better side of things. And that's what he taught me. That's what our friendship resulted in me, the change in me. And when he comes back, I hope he comes back. I plan on treating him to their McDonald's for some chocolate chip cookies."
21,naked.wav," I grew up in a really small town in Alabama. And my sister was, and is to this day, a remarkably beautiful woman. And I was always really good in school. So it fell into this pattern with my family where people would say things like, she's the beauty, you're the brain. And among my almost anorexically petite friends growing up, at five foot five, 140 pounds, it was universally acknowledged that I was a fat one. The whole thing really started in first grade, I have to say. There was a weigh-in in school. My best friend, Ann Cole, who was going to become the head cheerleader of our high school, hopped on the scale and weighed 45 pounds. But when I jumped on, the needle cropped, it creeped up to 50. And I looked over and I could see Ann looking at me in horror, not just for me, but for herself. And she suggested right then and there that I'd go on a diet. And so I did. For the next 20 years. I would never wear a bathing suit without putting a t-shirt over it first. I would never change a sleepover party without getting in the sleeping bag. I would never let a lover see me naked with a lights on. And not once, to never stand in front of my closet, to pick out an outfit with any other intention other than to look as thin as possible. Now along the way, well-meaning people tried to help, but just made things worse. Such as my stepmother, the Baywatch extra, who decided when I was 11, 11 years old, she decided to give me a makeover. But the result was something like if you put blue eyeshadow and frosty pink lipstick on a cabbage patch kid. It wasn't good. But somehow, I managed to get through high school and college. And at age 26, I packed up my baggage and moved to Southern California, where surprisingly, I actually got better. There was something about all the extreme views people had about their body, all the fake everything and the bleach blonde hair. They made me kind of give a hop. I think I kind of threw in the towel. And so I joined the gym down the street because it was cheap. And I discovered that lifting weights could be actually fun because you would get strong. And then with my newfound muscle tone, I put on shorts for the first time ever. It went for a hike, which led to a run. And then when food was no longer the enemy, I started cooking healthy food. And after six months, I actually lost 20 pounds. And one day, I was getting dressed to go out. And I actually glanced in the mirror, which of course I usually avoided. And I realized I almost didn't recognize myself. And I examined myself from head to toe, standing there in my brown panties, and discovered that actually couldn't lose any more weight. And I actually looked pretty darn good. Now, around the same time, my boyfriend was back in Boston, and he decided to produce an independent film. And he was begging me to come back to East and produce the film for him. But in order to do that, I calculated that was going to have to raise $2,000 over the next four months, somehow extra, which my $11 an hour temp job really was going to produce. So I went out and got a copy of the LA Times. And as I was perusing the ads for like, you know, Chuck E. Cheese Night Manager, and you know, evening legal secretary work, I saw an ad that said, dancers wanted earn up to $500 a night. Now, you have to understand that I cannot dance. I'm somewhat famous on my own friends for having tripped over my own feet when I was in college in Boston. It actually not myself unconscious on the sidewalk. It's true. So I ignored it and went to the other ads, but I kept coming back to it like $500 a night. So I threw you on the newspaper, and I ran to my room, and examined my butt carefully in the mirror. Like, couldn't be that my butt was good enough. And I picked up the phone and made an appointment with a woman named Samantha. Now, my best friend, Steve, was very against this. He's a Catherine. Your newfound self-esteem has been too long coming and too hard one. For you to risk it all because some bitch down at the strip club doesn't think you're good enough. And I knew he was right, but somehow couldn't stop. I just had to see. So the next day, I put on my sluddiest outfit, and made my hair huge and put on like all the makeup I owned. And I went down. And as I walked into the club, the most beautiful woman I've ever seen to this day was pulling herself upside down naked, up a pole with grace. And I was like, what am I doing? But just then I heard someone say, you must be Renee. Now, Renee was a totally insane alcoholic legal secretary that I worked with. And I was hoping to channel her. So I picked that as my fake name. And I said, yes, I'm Renee. And I thought that there was going to be all these questions. And I had memorized this detailed personal history that was all a lie. But she just took one look at me and said, when can you start? So while I wanted to, when in my head I was thinking, like, no way. I was like, how about Monday? And she said, OK. Over the weekend, I went out and bought a brand new pair of silver panties and a silver push up bra and these really amazing silver high heels. Now Steve was still trying to talk me out of it. He was like, Catherine, the smarter the stripper, the more they hate stripping. What are you going to do when some asshole comes up to you and says, hey, you're pretty hot. Do you want to give me a blowjob afterwards in the parking lot? You're going to want to tell him to fuck off. But what you're going to have to do is go, well, I'll get fired if I do that. But I'll be fantasizing about it the entire time you're on stage. And he said, do you think you can do that? And I was thinking, you know, for $500 and $200, maybe I can. So, so, so insanely that Monday morning, I actually went to work at my temp job. And so at five o'clock, I got off and showed up at the club wearing my tipping outfit, which was these very baggy, awful black pants, a little sailor top, my hair, you know, very straight in my glasses. And as I walked in, I was told to go over and tell the DJ what my song would be. And I walked in and I was like, hi, I'm the new girl. I'll be dancing to the land this more set. And he was just like, all right. And he says, the dresser room's over there. And I looked at the dress room and suddenly I realized that behind that dressing room were probably 10 drop-dead gorgeous women. And I was like, oh my God. And so I looked at the door and I looked at the door of the club. And just then I heard, hey, you must be the new girl. I'm Chloe. And that turned into my right, was this little Patricia Arquette sort of knock off girl. And she was wearing stars on one boob and spangle on the other. And one of the 70 styles bikinis with a little silver skirt. And she was adorable. And she was like, hi, I'll show you the way. So Chloe grabs me by the hand, drags me off, and leaves me into the dressing room. And I started getting dressed for the other girls. And actually the other girls were pretty nice. And so they explained to me the rules of the club, which I hadn't known before. In the first place, the first song you did in your bra and panties and whatever you wore after. And they were like, the only second song is Topless. And I was like, the second song is Topless. I think that whole time I'd been picture with that. I would just go out on the stage and flip it around and then let the very end. I dropped my bra and run. But no, you had to be Topless for an entire song. And I'm like, oh, no. But I was like, OK, and they're all looking at me. I can't back out. So I'm taking off my clothes. And everybody's just naked. And so just then, I'm the DJ, who's just 300 pound man named Rudy, comes into the room. And he says, and he's like, who are the girls? And all the girls are kind of, ah, really? Get out. Ah. And I'm naked. And I didn't even care. And I realized at the time that maybe I'd gone somewhere that had never been before mentally. And maybe I was going to get through this night. So Rudy leaves. And I'm starting to get some of the girls going, no, you can't wear the silver panties. You have to wear a G string. And I was like, oh, no, I don't have a G string. Well, bye, bye, bye. But Janay, who was this leaky blonde from Texas who's claimed to fame, was she stripped into her six month of pregnancy? Janay says, hi. I just washed mine. Here, you can borrow this. And she throws it at me. I'm like, all right. I'm putting out a strange girl's G string. And I put it on. And so the girls helped me do my hair and they make a huge. And they put on my makeup and like fake eyelashes and all this stuff. And I was ready to go. And as I walked out, I glanced in the mirror. And I have to say that I looked unbelievable. So, hey. So I go out and I go back out to Rudy. And I'm like, hi, I'm ready for my song. And he looks at me. And he's like, holy shitbox. All that was under there. And I was like, thank you. So then Chloe starts giving me a tour of the club. And as she's doing this, this guy comes up to us on crutches. He claims he'd been shot in a gang fight. And he comes up to him and he goes, you're pretty hot. You know, I'll put you in a music video if you'll give me a blowjob after the show. And I'm like, Steve, you know, and Chloe says, you know, grabs, you know, jumps back in screams, fuck you. She's a stripper. No, the guy damn hard. And it was just like, nice. Nice. So then we walk back out. And it's horribly the beautiful woman from like the audition day was out on stage again. And she was incredible dancer. And she's running around. And I'm just like, oh my god. But so I could tell Chloe. I'm like, you know, I'm really a little nervous. And she goes, no, no, no. You'll have no problem. She's like, it's not the best dancers that make all the money. It's the girls you can really connect with them in. You can look from guy to guy to guy and make the guy think that they're only looking at them. And it's really not being about a dancer. They just want to see you nude up there. But the biggest problem you're going to have is that you're going to get bored. No. Being bored was not something that occurred to me. It was going to be a problem. But she's like, no, you know, I have a special trick. It's called the drop in roll. So what you do, you know, as you go out there and you sort of like slowly, slowly, slowly slowly lower and like slowly, slowly, slowly roll around. She's like, they'll picture you rolling around in their beds. And then slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly stand back up. And if you do it slow enough, it could take up like two minutes. And I was like, great. So I go out. And so then slowly has to do her song. And I go and I sit down near the door. And I get a coke to drink because I didn't want to drink alcohol because I had to drive home. Like I'm such a nerd. And so I sit there. And all of a sudden, like it was a really cold night. And the wind blew in and I got really cold. And of course, I hadn't eaten for like three days because I was so nervous. And I kind of like today. And so I was like, I started to freak out and I looked up and I was just like, what am I doing? And I go over to Chloe who's come off stage now. And she's sitting next to Mr. Shot in the Leg Guy. Like they've made up now. They're friends again. And so I go over and I'm like, hi. You know, I was like, you have been so great. And thank you so much. But I just realized that I can't dance. So I'm going to go home and practice. And then I'm going to come back. And Chloe looked at me right in the eyes. And she said, if you walk out of that door right now, you will never come back. And you'll regret it for the rest of your life. And I knew that she was right. And just then Mr. Shot in the Leg Guy reaches out like under the little dress somewhere. And grabs my bare ass. And he squeezes it and he slaps me in the ass. And he says, you know, this is the worst. You feel this. This is the worst thing that's going to happen to you all night. And he smacks me. He goes, now get up on that stage. And I was like, all right. And so I went out on stage. And you know, it's all went out and I walked over and there was a pole. And so I was just swall around the pole. And like Chloe is running around. And everyone's a yell and scream. I should very supportive friend. And so I'm running around. But in all of a sudden, insanely, I run out of things to do. And I'm like, ah, the dropping roll. So I'm like, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, roll, roll, roll, roll. And as I'm rolling around, I feel something hit my cheek. And I'm like, oh my god, I'm so bad. They're throwing napkins at me. And by turn my head to the right on stage. And I open my eyes. And I saw that it was a dollar bill. And I was like, and so then I'm like, lean back like this. And I see Sandy above me is Mr. Shaw in the gang fight man. And he's standing over me with a roll of ones pulling them off and dropping them down on top of me. And all I could think was, I swear to God, was what would my ophthalmologist father back in Alabama think if he could see me right now? So but then everyone was throwing money. And it was amazing. And so I got up. And then it came to finally be the dreaded topless song. So I went to the special topless part of the stage. And the song started. And I unhook my bra very slowly. And slowly the strap and slowly the strap. And then I let the bra drop to the floor. And I stood there in front of 150 people wearing only a G-string. The whole crowd went nuts. And I have to say it was one of the most amazing moments of my entire life. No one in that club gave a shit when I made my SAT. No one cared. That was a strange student. No one cared. That was in the gifted class when I was eight. They just wanted to see me nude. And it was so cool. I never went back to the club after that night. And the first place security was pretty relaxed. Chloe kept making little passing marks. Right. OK. Chloe kept making remarks about how only a few of her friends had been killed by customers, which I found disconcerting. But the worst part was the next day at work, walking across the Sony lot, suddenly was examining every strange man that passed me. I was noticing them and checking them out. And I've always been one of the, and they seemed kind of yucky to me. I was sort of, every man was suddenly a customer. And I've always been one of those women that really loves men. And I thought, if this is where I'm after three hours, what am I going to be like after three months or three years? But several good things came out of it. In the first place, one of the customers taught me this really cool trick, which is the guy's pine. You hold his hand, because he thinks you're holding his hand. But what you're doing is you're holding his hand off of you. This came in super handy the next summer. You make a career as a film producer. But the best thing of all is that to this day, any time I'm having a fat day, or I've just broken up with someone, or I'm just feeling a little down about myself, all I have to do is open the door and peek into the back of the closet where I still keep those silver high heels. And I know in my heart that everything is going to be OK. Thank you."
22,afatherscover.wav," Good evening. I'm the first child and daughter of a pastor. I grew up as the only child for eight years and I was very close to my dad. He used to call me his princess, his Cinderella. I used to get piggyback rides and use this afro to pretend I was a hairdresser. Who were that close? But you see as a pastor you get to share your time, your emotions, your resources, your space and your family with the rest of the society. Everyone just wants a part of you. Some people want to pray. Others want to come for counseling. People just want you to be there for them. And slowly my father and I, we begin to drift apart. As a pastor's daughter you are expected to be actively involved in church and I was actively involved. I used to sing in the choir. I love singing. I used to add dramas, take Bible quizzes. I was everywhere in church doing everything I could do. It seemed as if I was a mini pastor myself. In Nigeria, pastors and their families are not expected to do anything wrong. They are held to such high standards. As they were second to God. And then I get pregnant. I know married teenage daughter of a pastor. I was brought up in a Eurobar community. The Eurobar is one of the three major tribes in Nigeria. And they have these high values and morals, especially when it comes to sex. They found against premarital sex. And the applauded virginity. In fact, when you're getting married in Eurobar communities, they give your husband a white hand and a knife to put on you during your first intercourse. He would let us show everyone that hand and a knife to show that you are a virgin. And here I am. A 17 year old teenage on married daughter of a pastor. Breaking the code of the community and of the church. I think of my father, mostly. I think of what the church will say. And so I try to sort things out myself. Abortion is illegally in Nigeria, except of course the pregnancy is harmful to the life of the mother. So most times, abortions are unsafe and done at the backyards. And I went one of such backyards. The environment was dirty. I wish I could describe. And the equipment's very hideous. I went the first time. I ran away. And I think of my father again and I come back. But the environment is still dirty. In fact, I think it's more dirty this time. And the equipment's are still hideous. So I get scared and I run away. And I feel what could go wrong. I'm not going to have this abortion in this dirty place. It was that I can go wrong is to unopt my parents. So I decide to tell my father. I know opportunity presents itself. Until one few morning, my father and my mother are having a discussion. I keep locking around corners. And my father calls out to me, bless it. She has something to say. I notice you locking around corners. For lack of better words to use, I blocked. I'm pregnant. My mother is shocked. You know how we men are. We can be very dramatic. She is shocked. She is furious. My father sits there. Silent. Trying to take in what I just said. He asks me what I want to do with it. I explained to him of course. I've tried to have an abortion there. But I couldn't. And he goes, I hope you can live with the consequences of your actions. And I wonder what consequences, what could be harder than telling you my father. But you see, those consequences are not far off. Because I'm no longer active in church. I stop going to church. And people are beginning to talk. People are beginning to have, they begin to have their own suspicions. And in fact, at that period, many people who come to my house for counseling just come on that, the guys of counseling, but they really want to confirm if blessing is pregnant. Many of them go the extra mile and ask my dad, oh, how is blessing? Where is she? It's belonging with so her. And then my dad has to call me out to say hello. And they look at me closely to confirm if I'm pregnant. I feel ashamed. And most times, I feel pity for my dad because people had judging him because of me. One Sunday morning, my dad later admitted that he heard someone pass his night comment about me. So during service, my dad walks up to the podium. And I'm in the congregation wondering what is he doing? Because you see, my dad never breaks protocol. And he wasn't built to speak that day. So I'm wondering what is he doing? And he walks up to the podium, one like this, but he removes the mic. And he goes, I'm not here to preach. I'm here to tell you that blessing is pregnant. And time freezes. Everyone goes silent. People who are walking, who are moving, they freeze at the spot. You could literally hear a pin drop. And when I'm sitting, I'm like, oh, God, I wish that it's quick, we just happened. And swallow me. And he continues. He says, I know you all have high expectations of her. But I'd like you to let us handle this as a family in our privacy. You see, in that moment, my father was accepting that he was human and that his family may included a human too. Teenage pregnancy comes with a lot of stigma and discrimination. But you see, that act by my father was a child. He went a long way to reduce whatever stigma and discrimination I was eventually going to face. My father walks up the podium, gallantly. As though he's not dropped a bombshell on everyone. I was seven months gone at the time. Two months later, I'd welcome a beautiful baby girl into my life who my father named Glory. And he was there. He was there for me. From the moment my father made that announcement to the church, he was there for me. We became closer. That distance was not there anymore. He became my closest confidant. There's nothing I cannot talk to my father about. Because you see, my father, in that period, he didn't think of his position. He didn't think of what the society thought. He didn't think of everything he had built. He thought of me. He thought of my future. He knew that I could become something greater. And he held my hand at every step of the way. He still holds my hand. My father let me realize that no matter what we go through in life, there will always be someone or that group of people that will hold your hand, that will keep nudging you on. And that family will always, always be family."
23,buck.wav," So, as I sit down to eat from this spread that has been given in my honor, I can't help but to notice the two feelings that I'm having. One, I'm a little nervous. Two, I'm very excited because you see, in the morning, I'll be paroling from state prison after 26 years. The spread is given to me, not as like to say, hey, homie, we appreciate you. No, I was a spread to say, we don't never want to see your ass in here again. And they broke out the finest of the finest. Top ramen, chili, and a can, roast beef and a can, you know, this top line of stuff, right? So after the spread has been had, it's time for me to give away some property, such as my TV, my radio, and some self-help books that helped me a lot. So they'll be better utilized left behind. Nine o'clock rolls around, it's lights out. You don't have to go to sleep, but you do got to get off the day-round floor. It's cool about me, I'm leaving in the morning. So I may have gotten like three hours worth of sleep that night. I slept ready roll, and that means I slept with my clothes on. As soon as they call my name, I'm out of there by, see you later. So five, 45 rolls around, and night man says, sippery and D37, 87, 5, report to R&R. I walked down that corridor for the last time. I walked through one gate after another time I get to R&R, and that's receiving and release. And I'm on the release end at this point. I get to R&R, and that's about seven to six other guys waiting for the same thing. They start fingerprinting me mug shots and everything. I'm cool, like time to go. So they load us onto a van, and we drive through one gate after another gate until we get to the final gate. The cop says, all right, everybody off the van, you'll step to the man at the base of the tower there, and you'll give him some personal information. So we did, and he gave each man an envelope with $200 in it, better known as gate money. We all got back onto the van and drove through that last gate. We made it around to the visitor's parking lot. Any ex, is there anyone with a ride? I do. I was the only one to get off the van. These other guys at $200 gate money, they had to spend it on buying their bus tickets, maybe back to Southern California, or farther up north. But I was the lucky one. My wife was waiting there. With her camera, I could see her. She was snapping pictures of me like a paparazzi. I walked briskly towards her, gave her a quick kiss, whispered in her ear. Let's get out of here before they say we made a mistake. We got in the car, drove away. I saw a 7-Eleven. I was like, hey, babe, pull over. I'm going to go in and get something. So I went in and grabbed a pack of big red gum. I hadn't had chewing gum in 26 years. Big red was my favorite. We got back in the car, drove away. We were on the road for about 30 to 45 minutes. I spotted a target. I said, hey, babe, that's target. I saw that on the TV. Pull over. I want to go in there. So we did. The first thing that caught my eye was how big the shopping basket was. It was bigger than the space that I had to store my personal property while in prison. I grabbed the basket and went down the aisle, grabbing various things such as underwear, socks, t-shirt, toothbrush, toothpaste. You name it, I grabbed it. Well, that goes at $200, gate money. So back in the car, and my wife says, so what do you want for dinner? Oh, she stumped me with that one. Because for 26 years, no one had ever asked me what do I want for dinner. My dinner came through a 13 by 13 hole in the wall. You stick your hand in there and pull out a tray. And whatsoever on there, that's what you eat. So she says, I know what to fix. So she drove. We made it to the grocery store. We went into the grocery store, this gigantic store, Berkeley Bowl. So I made it to the produce section. I'm stuck. There are so many oranges to choose from. And the reason, and I'm stuck just looking at the oranges is because for the past 10 years in prison, they had taken oranges away from us because they were used to make wine. So there's a bumpy orange, a smooth orange, a naval orange. I even met my first blood orange. And at the same time, this wave hit me of the loan and feeling like, I don't know, a nervous feeling hit me like, I'm the only person in this store who's parole from a prison today after 26 years. I'm a little stuck, a little woo-hoo-hoo. So I'm looking around and I spot this ink work. It's not the typical ink work that I see out here now, like what colored. Now I notice ink work, this is prison ink. He has a prison guard towering him a melted clock with time. I know that work. I've seen that many times. So I walk over to him and I whisper. So what yard did you parole from? He said, oh me? I got a parole from Pelican Bay like four months ago. I'm like, and they know you got out of prison? They know you're on parole? Oh yeah, they're not tripping here. This is Berkeley, man. Nobody's tripping. Well, I walked away from him with the understanding that if he can get a job, so can I. So I met my wife at the checkout. Once again, there's another stunned moment for me. There are 12 checkout lines. And there's somebody on the other end bagging the groceries. In prison, there was one window, maybe 13 by 13 again. And there was like 300 guys waiting to get into this one window with their lists. I didn't have to worry about an alarm going off or anything, no getting down. We're going to get our groceries and leave out of here. That was my thought. Cool. So we made it through the checkout, went back to the car, got in the car, and we're on the road, and we come to a stoplight. And this homeless guy had a sign that says, anything will help. So my wife reaches into the cup holder and gets ready to hand in some change. And all of a sudden, he gets a phone call. And he tells my wife, oh my God. And my thoughts would like, if he got a cell phone, I got to get one. So we drive away. And my wife, she just drives real fast, right? And we make it to the neighborhood just as fast as we got to the store. And she pulls into the neighborhood and she points out the various neighbors' house. This is where Fred and Mike live. The brewers live here. And I'm like, OK. And we get to our house and she said, this is us. And we live at the edge of the forest. I'm like, cool, cool. And so we went inside and she gives me the grand tour. And so she says, well, I'm going to prepare this dinner. I said, cool. So she made steak and lobster with small potatoes, nothing out of a can, folks. Nothing out of a packet, either. She made this meal. We sat down. We ate. And I had my first glass of wine with my meal. Nothing, I'm not saying I've never had wine before. I've never had wine with a meal. This is some grown folks, shit, I thought. Right? So after the meal was finished, we're cleaning up washing dishes. My wife says, you want to get further acclimated? I'm like, yeah. She said, take out the garbage. No problem. I reached down, tied that garbage bag up, threw it over my shoulder, and out to the front door I go. When I open up the door, no more than eight feet away from me was a ten point book. Just standing there, looking at me, looking at it, staring at me. Now have we been on a prison yard? I mean, his buck would have issues. Now I speak a lot of different gangster languages. I'm fluent in Crip. I understand blood. I even speak a little West Holo Vato local. But I don't speak deer. So I shut the door. I called out to my wife. I said, hey, pay. There's somebody here to see you. She came to the door, opened it, and saw there was the buck. She grabbed the trash bag and walked right past it. I said, damn, she speaks deer. She came back and we both look out the door together at this buck who's still standing there just looking just majestic as could be. My wife says, you don't need to trip him. He's just one neighbor coming and welcoming you to the neighborhood. Cool. I thought, well, the fellas aren't going to believe this shit when I tell them this. I met my first deer. I met my first blood orange. I had my first glass of wine with my meal. Wow. This is my first day of my new life. What's tomorrow going to bring me? Thank you."
24,dialogue2.wav," I kind of ambushed you. I showed up at your church. And I remember asking you, did you have a few minutes? I wanted to talk to you privately, because you didn't know that you had a sister, no idea. No inkling, no hint, no nothing. It was shocking. It felt like I was staring at my mother. Cheekbones, eyes, even all the way down through chosen career path. Her being a teacher, you being a teacher. So I called my sister Camille, and I said, is it possible mom had a daughter before all of us? And she was like, I'm calling that. And him sharing that they wrestled with wanting to tell us. And especially when she got sick, when was the right time to say something? You know, once I found out that I am the result of a sexual assault that kind of took me for a loop. And so I struggled with, maybe I should have stayed away. Now all of the pain and the sadness that goes along with my very existence is out in the open. I remember crying every day, thinking through what our mother had to go through. And really thinking about how we were raised and how protective she was. And now fully understanding why. I remember being a child and going to the park to play baseball or basketball and having to check in, giving us the stranger speech over and over, not being able to go to a friend's house or birthday party unless she met everybody. You know, to have a child under the circumstances that I was born and then go on to marry and to have four more kids. I mean, that is just phenomenal strength. And so I do take heart in knowing that that's who I come from. That's part of my DNA, so to speak. I was birthed by a strong woman. I was raised by a strong woman. I remember thinking both moms would have been fast friends. Then so those missed opportunities, I feel sorrow around that. But I do think it happened how it was supposed to happen. Where our relationship has developed, it's exactly where she would want it to be. The only thing that's missing is her presence. But I think the way that which we were raised kept our heart soft over the years. And I think that that prepared us to one day meet you. My first year in college, Columbine was the very first page of my psychology textbook. That's when I had that feeling of like, whoa, people in my class are going to read about this. And I lived it. Why made you decide to come back and teach at Columbine? You know, I never wanted to come back to Columbine to teach. And at the moment, I was like, well, I just want a job. Right. And so I went back and it was hard. Yeah. I didn't know that it would affect me that much. In December of last year, they put us on lockdown. And it was my off-hour. And I didn't have any students. I could see police coming down the street. Nobody could get in or out of the neighborhood. And I was doing okay. I called my mom and I called my sister. And I said, hey, you just want to let you know there's a lockdown. I'm in the building. We're not quite sure what's going on. And then throughout the day, just kept getting like longer and longer. And I remember all these kids were like, you missed Cuck, what's going on? And I said, you know, I don't know. But this person, whoever did this to us, as you know, I don't curse at school, but I was pissed off because I remember feeling so in the dark as a student. And so I went right back to my 16 year old self. I walked into this old city's office and I called my sister and I said, I'm not okay. That's that moment I literally brought myself back to April 20th. I was so broken that day. You've built something that you wanted on top of the rubble. I weirdly feel proud that I walk into columnite every day. I'm doing the job that I've always wanted to do and I get to teach some of the best kids in the world. When you pile 67 year olds together in a small space, you're going to go through what everybody would expect, fear and tears and prayers. But as the minute's drag into hours, you start to become a 17 year old again, whether you like it or not. One of my friends was laughing and scared that she was going to diverge and a girl peed in Mr. Andres' thermos and we never told them about it. We popped the ceiling tiles off and we signed it in case we die. There was so much going on, I don't remember a lot of getting home. I remember standing outside, waiting for you. You walked right by me like I was a ghost. I was a ghost. I was just in a state of shock. That summer after a calm vine happened, I played softball nonstop. And I was so angry, I chewed so much bubble gum. I had 10 cavities. There's no real good way to express your anger. And it comes out in the weirdest places. I remember we would smoke cigarettes and pot in the men's room. In a Jefferson County police officer walked in and he's like, are you smoking pot? And we looked at him dead eyed and said, what the f*** are you going to do about it? And he pivoted and walked out the door. Yeah. You know, after the shooting, I definitely blocked out a lot of life before that. It eliminated most of that year for me, that academic year. Yeah, I remember my 16th birthday like going and getting my driver's license, but that's it. I can't tell you anything that happened up until the time that I sat down and I started taking a test and heard people screaming. In this year, it's just I have these dreams that are so vivid of me, you know, having to tell parents that their kids aren't coming out while I'm holding mine. It never goes away. Never. But recovery is a marathon and not a race and you just have to keep running it. So over 20 years, I had to let my anger go because if you don't let that anger go, it's going to consume you and it's consumed way too many of us. Yeah. And it's always good to have a brother that can relate. You've definitely have given me strength to heal. We're driving at rush hour and my sweet guy is screaming and grabbing me and we're just scared to death. This is not the guy I know at all. We were already anticipating what was going to happen in this emergency room because when he was a little boy, an officer got on his back while he was screaming and he's been handcuffed to gurneys in the emergency rooms just for having a seizure and being big that day. We show up at a hospital. Here's this giant six foot three guy, just bit his old mom. Yeah. I'm sitting there brokenhearted, scared out of my mind bleeding and Mark was trying to run away and I see like five guys on him and all I can think is this will not end well. They're going to kill him. But suddenly I hear this cute game. He's trying to escape and you're going, Walker gets up. Walker sits down. Walker's good. It's back. Walker lies down. And then he said, high fives all around and I thought he won't do it. And I look and he's beaming and he's high fiving every single officer. And then he started singing and I thought I would lose it forever. I started singing Mr. Rogers. They both sang in Mr. Rogers and these men. And he went from being terrified to feeling like he had cool friends, cool guys hanging out with him. I saw this man who was dealing with something he just did not understand. Yes. And I saw the fear in your face. It touched me personally. My son is 14. He was 15 months. He was first diagnosed as being autistic. And a father of a child who has autism, I don't know what changes is going to occur in him. And as parents, we're there to help them deal with their obstacles. And if we can't do it by ourselves, there's other people out there to help. And I want to be one of those other people. Well, nobody else does what you do. We look like a very scary situation coming in there and we turned into a kind of party. I think people wanted to join. I've been in a lot of years and some people have been kind of nice. I never said there and felt like this is one of the most important moments of my life. If you were to see Aunt Yaya back in the day, the way I saw her, she was tall. She had a beautiful angular face with high cheekbones and she had brown eyes. They almost looked like owl eyes scanning everything. When we came, my mom and my dad, they decided that I was going to go to Aunt Yaya's house. I was nine years old. And once the door closed, she says, how would you like to change into something that's really comfortable for you? And what was there? Were a blouse and a wig. I knew I was a girl. And so that weekend, I got to be me. We went shopping in my outfits. Everyone in the neighborhood knew Yaya and she would introduce me as her niece. Would you go home and mention anything like that? No. And when you go home, you have to be what they want. Because if you don't and they find you out, you will be hurt. She was the one who taught me early on that I have to play the game. Yaya, she had a lifelong friend and it wasn't until years later that I finally figured out that her friend was her lover and her partner. And you never spoke of that back in the day. Yaya never got the love she was supposed to from the rest of the family. And Yaya wanted me to be everything that she wanted to be if she could live her life over again. I loved her. She loved me back. And behind that white door became my place to be the little girl that I needed to be."
25,metsmagic.wav," It's the summer of 1965, the one right before junior high school. My parents are hard workers. That's what they did. They worked. Vacation was not a word in our family dictionary. So here I am, bored to death, just wishing for school to start already so I'd have something to do. So the one day I turn on the television set and I find the New York Mets. Now I don't know much about baseball at that point but I decided to have nothing else better to do so I might as well watch. So I watched the game and I realized that this is simple. I can follow this. There's nine players, nine innings. They come up and say, more to roll at the time and with my mets it's three up, three down. Very easy. I caught on quick. I caught on quick and by the end of the game I understood baseball. I know all the players names and I was hooked. So now my sister and I start watching all the televised games and my parents actually managed to take us to a couple of games over that summer of 65. By the summer of 1966 my sister and I are taking the Aaron Haif long trek out to Shea Stadium on the trains by ourselves and we're going as many to as many games as my father could get tickets to not realizing that it's easy to get tickets because the Mets is so cozy nobody else wants to watch them play. So in the meantime we don't care if they win or they lose we don't care how good or bad they are we don't even know that they're terrible. But when Mets fans and we're happy and then the season ends and we're sad and it takes until 1967 when I'm there with my parents watching the World Series that I realize if my team was good if they could actually get into first place win the National League my season wouldn't have to end because they could go to the World Series. So I asked my dad when the Mets get into the World Series will you take us when he says sure well in 68 comes we go to lots more games we're happy campers and 68 World Series comes along and of course the Mets are not in it and we ask our dad when the Mets get into the World Series will you take us and he says sure and of course my father knows the Mets finished last in 1968 and no one in the baseball world or in fact anybody in their right mind whatever expect that he was going to have to make do on a promise like this any time soon if ever. Well now if you're a Mets fan of a certain age you know what happened in 1969 straight from the Sella 9th place last place 9 out of 9 they shot right up to first place in 1969 and actually won the National League pennant and went into the World Series against the hard hitting Baltimore Orioles. So here we are they're back from Baltimore having won one and lost one so they're even even coming into New York to Shay Stadium for games three four and five on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday even one one. So Monday I don't see any Mets tickets so I'm hearing on the radio that they're hard to get because in hundreds of dollars it's going to be record breaking crowd standing room only and I'm worried so I asked dad are we going to the World Series and he says don't worry about it so Tuesday comes Tuesday goes we don't go to the game but the Mets managed to win so now they're going into Wednesday to game three no to game four leading two games to one. Of course that night we are asking dad are we going to the World Series he says don't worry about it well now I'm worried because you know there's only two games left here in New York and even if they win and they're going to win them both and they're going to win it here at home or they're going to go back to Baltimore and play the last two but either way there's only two games for me to watch if for me to get a chance to go and share this with them. So anyway Wednesday comes we again watch them win on TV they manage to win without us Wednesday night I'm asked there I am asking dad again like a broken record are we going to the World Series and he says don't worry about it so here it is Thursday afternoon today when they can win it all and we're home so we're getting ready I'm resigned now to watch this game on TV and all of a sudden my mother comes into the kitchen with two tickets in her hand this hand and the car keys in the other so now I am overjoyed and panic stricken so I look at the clock and I see there's no way even if my mother drives us to the train there's no way that we are going to make it to this game for the start of the game. So the nights when I know we're in the car and before I realize it we're not going in the direction of the train we're going the opposite way and I'm understanding that my mother this woman who has never driven out of the neighborhood intends to take us to the ballpark well I don't know how we got there but it was in record time and my very next memory is of my mother arguing with the parking lot attendant because they want to pay the fee and she's refusing to pay and this is going back and forth and the meantime getting more and more nervous and all the cars behind me would be perfectly happy to pay their fee and get into this ballpark and time to watch this great game of the century and this is getting the attention now of police officer so he comes on over and he wants to know what's the hold up the attendant tells him this this woman won't pay so he says lady you better have a good reason so she says this three of us only two tickets I'm not staying I'm just dropping them off this lady you're crazy what are your nuts I've never let my kids go and I had the chance to go to a game like this but he felt so sorry for her and so impressed that she was doing this for us that he waived her on in for free and even told her how to get back on the parkway so she rushes us to the nearest gate we've run in we have to stop for the national anthem but with this close with this close to our seats and we actually managed to slip on in there as the first pitch is being thrown well the rest is history you all know what happened the next one the world series they became world champs and I was there best sports moments ever for me still to this day all these years later best moment ever so now here I am at the end of the game I'm on the seven train coming home with all these jubilant match fans screaming and yelling I'm holding on to a dear life and I'm clutching my souvenir right field grass close to my heart and I'm thinking how one earth did my father come up with these tickets and what an earthed my mother thing and when did she get these tickets and what was she thinking that she couldn't go and what gave her the strength to think that she could drive us there right some sit now I'm a smart kid I know what parents are all about I know they're supposed to keep you safe they're supposed to provide you the basics they're supposed to teach you right from wrong and maybe give you a little encouragement now and then but when I'm standing there it occurs to me that it parenting is more than that it's about keeping promises and about self sacrifice and I'm thinking to myself right then I'm there that if I'm ever blessed to have children of my own that I want to be the kind of parent that my parents were that day"
26,life.wav, So I get a phone call from my mom and she tells me that my father is about to get on an emergency life flight from our home in Montana to go to Denver to get an emergency liver transplant. My mom is kind of perennially optimistic and she's telling me don't worry it's gonna be okay we're gonna pull through this it's gonna be all right but I know something is really wrong so I get the next flight I can to go from where I'm leaving here in New York hoping that I get there before my father dies and I'm really glad I got that flight as fast as I did because I was able to spend a couple hours with my father before it passed away and before I know it I'm at this side of his hospital bed with my mom and we're sobbing because he's passed my dad was a he was a strong silent type he was he was a grew up on a farm and he was the town one of one of two town eye doctors so he could fix anything you know he could fix tractors or eyes he can you know no matter what he was always doing it like behind the scenes you know he never wanted to take credit for it it was a parent that my mom and I and my two brothers were gonna have to be fixing things ourselves this time around and the first thing my mom did was was to call my two brothers one a year older one is a year younger and it was gonna be really comforting to see my younger brother we were really close it was gonna he was really gonna support me it was gonna be much more complicated seeing my older brother we'd always had a really complicated relationship and there was something really big about me that he did not know and that's that the last time he saw me years and years before I was male he was not aware that I had transitioned from being male to being female and you know I always wanted to tell him I was trying to find the right time the right place trying to you know get up the nerve I was worried about his reaction maybe that you know he was a bit conservative yet a temper I didn't know how it's gonna happen and I just kept putting it off and never found the right time and here we are at the time where I have to deal with all this stuff Mark wasn't the only one who didn't know my story my whole hometown didn't know about me either and you know I was trying to find a way to tell Mark I just kind of figured with my hometown I just I just would never go back there again so my mom calls my brother and in one fungal tells him that he lost his father and then he now has a sister and I have to say I mean Mark was he was really great he got off the plane we met him at the airport he gave me a hug but it was awkward as he can imagine and you know I think we did what a lot of families do at times like that you just kind of fall back on tradition and we wanted to do something that my mom and dad had always done every year because you see it was my father's birthday he had passed away 20 minutes before before his 65th birthday so we all went to Applebee's and we got a slice of sizzling apple pie put a candle in it and my brother Mark who really worshiped my father got the honor of of blowing out the candle and winning was blowing out the can I'm I'm still remember the expression on his face he was you know trying to process my father's passing he was figuring out why it had been so long that the two of us hadn't talked something that really frustrated him and it was this all kind of coming together I took a business card out of my purse it was for this job that Mark didn't even know I had I had my new name on it and I wrote my cell phone number on it and I gave it to Mark I said look you know we haven't talked for so long but here anytime any place no barriers call me any we're you know we can talk anytime you want and my mom started crying because her you know her her children were reuniting and also because you know for years she had been running interference between the two of us and using every excuse in the book to explain why I wasn't getting back to him or why you know packages to me were being returned because they had the wrong name on them and you know her job running interference was over so Mark was in shock we were all in shock I was in shock because I was thinking about the fact that you know nobody in my hometown knew and I'm wondering if I can go back for the for the funeral if I if I should go back if my mom and my brothers really want me to really deep down and I'm thinking that you know I never even thought I was gonna go back to my hometown and now I'm being I'm being pulled back right into it as contradictory as it may seem as soon as there was a reason to go back I had this really deep strong yearning to go back I mean I had gone to school in New York and San Francisco and traveled all over the world in this place that I thought of as home that I think I really repressed knowing that I couldn't go back there right I don't need to go back there but as soon as there was a reason for me to go back there very strong reason I really really wanted to go I wanted to see the house the only house I had ever known growing up I wanted to go back to my hometown and these people that you know comprises community that I thought of as home right and my mom reassured me that she she wanted me to be there that she in fact needed me their first support my brothers too and my mom had a plan to get us there you know our family had been separated for a long time so she had the idea for all of us to rent a car and drive the 20 hours from Denver back to Montana so before you know there we are in the car you know my brother hasn't seen me for years especially not as female and here we are and we we had so much to do we were planning we were planning to serve it my father's funeral service we were writing his obituary my mom wanted to figure out and I did too want to figure out how we could introduce the information about me was still keeping the focus on my father so she had me driving out in the you know across Wyoming 70 miles an hour she had me take dictation of her friends and she wanted to invite them over for tea so she had this really strategic list it's like you invite Judy and she's going to tell all the people in the arts community that my mom was involved in and you're gonna tell June and June is gonna tell all the people that dabbed off us and we'll find somebody else and she's gonna tell everybody at the church and the next night there they were 18 of my mom's best friends and the minister from the church where the service was was gonna be performed they're drinking tea my mom says you all know very well by now that I've lost my husband and I know a lot of you have wondered what happened to my middle son who seemed to disappear and she said I want you to know tonight that yeah I have a daughter and her name is Kim and this is my child and I love my child and I hope you do too and we can focus on this tonight we can talk about this tonight you all are my ambassadors if someone has questions at the funeral and I'm caught up in things I want I'm going to point them to you and let you tell this story because you can talk about it in a sensitive way and she you know took a couple a couple questions from the people there and the whole tea party and dude slightly different than the tea party we hear about in the news the whole thing ended with everybody raising their tea cups and saying hip hip hooray for Kim hip hip hooray for Kim there were a couple amends and some applause and and then everybody went home and I swear there was a brown out from all the simultaneous phone calls that were being made dispensing the information right so then the next thing there was a viewing of my father's body at the funeral home and I had elected not to go because you know I didn't want the focus to be on me I was gonna keep it on everybody and keep it on my father but my best friend Tim from high school was at the viewing and he calls me up he had only known the new me for a couple days I hadn't even told him but he knew me really well and he knew I was chickening out and he called me from the the funeral and you said hey I got a lot of people here they really want to see you I should probably tell you that the people he's talking about are the football team because I used to be on the football team and so applause for that and and so Tim says where are you I got a lot of people want to see you I'm like yeah I don't want to go and you know I want to keep the focus on my dad I don't want to be the he's like yeah whatever either you come down here or we're gonna come up there what's it gonna be I said I've got you I come up here I guess so before I know the football team is at my front door and a couple of them have cases of beer under their arm one case gets tossed in the snow bank to keep it cold it's just like high school and all of a sudden they're in my living room and it's this wake instantly and this show of support for me and for the memory of my father right and they're in my living room this living room I never even thought I would see again and people are either laughing or crying mostly laughing and I remember looking around the room and there's there's Kevin he was one of the co captains of the football team with me and I look over there and there's my brothers Mark and Todd and they were you know we were all very close in age so we had friends in common and they're telling stories about my dad and there's I look I look over on the couch and there's Frank I probably should have all you also told you that not only was I on the football team but I was the quarterback and so I look over the couch and there's Frank he's an offensive lineman it's the job of an offensive lineman to protect the quarterback and Frank is protecting me once again 20 years later under very different circumstances and he's got his arm around my girlfriend they're laughing and knocking back cans of cheap beer and that was the moment that I knew things were going to be okay somehow and there was one more person there that night and that was my mom and she told me something that we ended up repeating quite a bit that weekend through the services she came up and she said you know dad was always fixing things and it looks like he fixed this too she said you know even though your father has died you've been reborn thank you very much
27,dialogue5.wav," Did it make you feel apprehensive about dating me? No, it didn't make me apprehensive. It was almost like it's okay, it's cool, but not even fully grasping what that meant. I was a US foreign citizen, and I think I didn't realize that I would start living some of that indirectly through spending time with you. So I started working as an immigration attorney. It's weird to be undocumented. It's weird to be in those offices with somebody else who also is in the same situation. You've mentioned to me that sometimes you're scared, or you're sort of nervous when I go to an immigration court, or when I go to ICE. Because I imagine you going in there and talking smack and just kind of standing up for your clients, and I just imagine you saying the wrong thing. Tell me the truth, have you ever been afraid? I'm always afraid. When I went to my first ICE check-in with a client, it's on the fourth floor, and it's just completely packed with a brain, and you cannot walk around. It's very hot. It's almost suffocating. Sometimes I'm curious if they know about my status. Yeah, and we've kind of built an unswoken system for you telling me in the morning that you will be at a nice check-in, and then I say, please be careful, and then you text me when you're out and safe, and I say, thank God. It does weigh me down a little bit. It is a very specific cloud hanging over us. It just feels like we're at Paws. Travel plans are Paws. Long-term plans are Paws. You know, we want to buy a house. We really can't take too many steps in any direction until we have this resolved. So it is hard. What did our wedding day feel like for you? I think I felt that peace. Yeah, like it's a start of something new for us. We've been together for over five years now. You've been very supportive and very caring, and so many ways. I wonder how you feel when you no longer have that title of undocumented person, but I'll be there with you. So, I'm ready. All right, let's do it. You were one of the first person I talked to, and you know, I'm a very sheltered life. So I thought you were a little crazy, and that was part of how we survived. After one firefight, he came to me and showed me a helmet with a bullet hole in it, and I can't believe that you're alive. Oh, I can say with John, I think you have a very hot head. Yeah, I remember that day, but that was the day where a lot of other guys weren't as lucky as me. Our platoon went from like 29 guys to 10 guys in two days. So the guys that were left, we had even stronger bonds because we had survived this together. And you know, when you lose friends, you develop a hard exterior, and you don't want to make friends with anyone else. So I don't have a big circle of friends. I think that's just one of many hang-ups I brought home with me. When I got home, most of the time, I tried to forget the whole experience and not think about it too much. And I didn't try to contact anyone, because I'm not sure you guys want to be contact. Yeah, like you, I just melted into the woodwork, like a chameleon. But I thought about UK. And one time I was down in San Francisco, and I ripped a page out of the San Francisco phone book that's got all the leads with the first initial K, and I started going through making phone calls. How many leads do you think are out there? A lot. Yeah, it took years to find you, but I found my long lost buddy, and it was just like we'd never been apart. John, we were so lucky. We survived it now, and we still here. Yeah. I've learned from you how to try to stay calm at times, even when the world's exploding around you. And that's why your friendship means the world to me. It's hard to describe, but the friendship and the bond that you formed during battle is different than most friendship. It's like family now. It feels very grateful for your effort to find me. Well, I feel like I'm a treasure hunter, and I found the treasure when I found you. I'm a single father. I have two children. I actually grew up in Griffin's Baldwin County. If you're born in that county, you have like a 16% chance of getting out of poverty. So I'm like the 16%. And I tell that to my children, there's no excuses. It comes from within. And something that I also conveyed to my children. My parents grew up with nothing. My mom didn't have shoes, didn't have food, that kind of thing, and you know, she's the one kid that put herself through college as a single parent. When you think about the future, where are you most scared of? I am just really nervous for my kids, right? Like I feel like right now, everything is just mean and nasty. But instead of reacting with kindness or compassion, people are quick to react with. I guess hate or anger, and not just like me and you're doing a center of talking and trying to understand perspectives. Is there one thing that you respect about the way that I see the world? No. Fair enough. I think you said that you want the best for this country. I respect that view, and I agree with that view. Okay. Is there anything that you respect that I said today? That you're a hardworking single father that wants what's best for his children. And I think that that's commendable and common between you and I for sure. So. Thank you. I remember playing capture of the flag. And I looked up and I saw somebody who was holding something and just hit by thought it was a power drill. And then the next thing I remember is someone picked me up. And I just remember kind of bouncing in their arms. They put me down on the floor and they covered me with blankets. And I just kept screaming call 911, call 911. I remember sitting in the hospital room with you that evening and his picture was on the TV. You looked up at it and you said, you know, that's the shooter. Do you remember why you thought he might have shot you? I don't think it was until I was preparing for my Burmitsville that I really started to think about the fact that it was because I was Jewish. And, you know, I know you and mom were so careful about making sure that I didn't stray away from my religion just because I was targeted for it. The last thing I wanted you to do was to be afraid of being Jewish. Some of it went back to my childhood. My mother had told me stories from the 40s and 50s. Now all of a sudden through my six year old to experience this. Yeah. You know, one of the most difficult things for me was I could never assure you I could protect you. You know, I could never put my arms around you and say, don't worry, Josh, I'll keep you safe. Because I couldn't. And for me, as I started to reflect on why I was shot, I started to think of all of the good things that came from Judaism as opposed to this one terrible thing. I started to remember that it's my view on life. It's making sure that I treat everyone with compassion. And that was more of what Judaism meant to me rather than a threat to who I was. Tell us a little bit about yourself. I am a martial artist. I play the stand up bass. I am learning how to play the guitar and I am transgender. What level are you in martial arts? I'm a level two blue belt. That means I'm half way to black belt. What is your favorite subject in school? PE. PE. Our lunch. What grade level were you in school when you decided to tell your friends and family that you're transgender? It was around fifth grade when I told my friends and family I was transgender because up until then I did not know that the word existed. It was misery every day. I hated being called a girl. I hated being called a daughter. But most everybody, my family, friends, they were just okay because they kind of knew it was coming. Yeah. Over the summer I went to art camp and they did not know I was transgender. They just called me. He, that was awesome. I think the happiest moment in my life would probably be January 16th, 2015. 8.45 pm. You bought me boxer pants. You'd been telling me for quite a while that you wanted boxers. If you were wearing all boy clothes, getting boy haircuts and that was like the final change. And you were just ecstatic. That was awesome. Is there anything else you would like for people to know about you? Well, even though I'm transgender, I'm a kid too. I have homework to deal with. I have tests to deal with. I have been extremely proud of you because you have been true to who you are. And you're very courageous. It shouldn't be scary to be who you are. I mean, maybe a little bit at first, but it's way happier this way. Trust me. I don't think you realize what a leader you are. People look up to you because you are not afraid to take a different path. And we know that it's your life and you're the one that's got to live it. But we are there for you every single step of the way. And we're going to do whatever we can to to lighten your load. I'm very proud to be your mom. I'm proud to be your son."
28,ifthishaircouldtalk.wav," So my pediatrician tells me when I go to see her at my daughter's one month well-check appointment. Melanie, you got to go to the hospital. I need you to get X-rays of IV skull because something's wrong and I'm going to tell you what's going on in a minute. And I'm like, well, I have a babysitter for like 20 more minutes, so can I do it next week? She goes, Melanie, I'm serious. You need to go right now. I'm like, okay, call the babysitter. And I go on to get these X-rays done. And I'm like, my baby's a month old. What do you need X-rays for? Sure, her head looks kind of funny, but that's a little endearing to me. I think it's adorable. So my doctor calls me later that day and she goes, Melanie, are you with your loved ones? Are you sitting down? I'm like, I'm with my three children all the time. One of them's eating right now. The other one's sleeping right now. So yes, what's going on? She goes, Melanie, IV has a really rare condition called craniosanotosis. And basically what this is is her head was asymmetrically formed in utero. And what happens is the, I'm going to get real technical, but it's basically like the plate tectonics theory in reverse order. You want their head to be kind of open with these cranial sutures. And so their brain can grow for the first years of the life. And then it kind of comes together and forms the former pangia. So that's how it made sense to me when they're telling me this over the phone. So I'm like, okay, so that's kind of cute. I don't know, is this a problem? And she goes, yes, Melanie, it is. What IV has is a right coronal suture. So basically, IV's eyes were completely asymmetrical. And I didn't know. I just thought it was like, oh, look at her little eyes. This one's small and that one's really big. And she's so cute, you know. And she's like, it's like 10 pounds of baby that I'm analyzing her skull. And she goes, what happened with IV is the right side of her head is completely flat because that bone, or that skull plate fused back in her head. And I was like, okay, so what? Does she have to wear one of those helmets? Because I could put stickers on it. And she'd be so cute with those little helmets with the little flowers. And I put her name like IV. And she'd be like all the rage at parades. Think of the throes, you know. And she goes, she goes, Melanie. IV has to have surgery or her brain won't grow. And when your daughter gets to have skull surgery, you get all the top doctors. I mean, you are celebrity status when you walk into the hospital. IV got her own neurosurgeon. She got her own, and yes, at one month old, my daughter had her own plastic surgeon. And this plastic surgeon is a wonder with his hands. He was a little weird to talk to, but he was phenomenal when he helped my daughter. And I go to the first appointment with the tag team neurosurgeon and plastic surgeon holding my, this point two month baby, with my husband. He goes, no, but I'm going to tell you about the surgery. And I said, okay, great. He goes, listen, this is what we do. We're going to cut her head open. We're going to cut her head up from ear to ear. And it's going to look like headphones. And I was like, me like those little pods that go down. He's like, no, like headphones. I was like, oh, oh, okay. He was French Canadian. I'm not saying anything about French Canadians, but there was like a disconnect sometimes. I didn't understand what it was saying. So it's like, we're going to cut her head. And I can't. And I can do accents. I can't do this guy. And sorry, he wouldn't be here. But, so I cut her head. So they're going to cut her head open. And he's like, and I will remove the forehead. And I will break it and reshape it. And I will put it back on. Using these really tiny screws that will dissolve over time. We're going to stitch her up and she's going to look like a price fighter for about a month, but then she'll be fine and she'll grow. And I'm like, let's say what? Like, isn't like microsurgery like really in now? Like, that just seemed quite invasive to me. And in my mind, I'm like, you're not touching her. She's fine. She's going to live with this wonky head. And we are going to love her. We are going to love her good because she's ivy. And she's our baby. And you're not going to cut her head open. But my only question that I was able to say was, so are you going to shave her hair off? And he goes, ma'am, I just told you I'm going to cut her head open. I'm going to have to shave her head and I go, sure fine, okay, whatever. And I go home and I'm like, good lord, like I thought that was going to a well check. And they go and drop this bomb on me that ivy has to have surgery. So the thing with this surgery is you have to wait. You have to wait until your daughter's a certain size or your son whatever. They can't be too tiny because it's really invasive. It's major surgery. It's blood loss. It's blood transfusion. It's hemorrhaging. It's brain damage. It's all the risks. Capital R, I, S, K. And they have to tell these things to you. And I go, okay, I'm like, does she have to have the surgery? He goes, yes. And I said, don't tell me the risk. Like, if I have to do it, I have to do it. And so we had six months from finding out about ivy to, well, if I know about her condition to the day of the surgery. And those six months were just awesome because I was like, you know what? I read the risk. I'm not going to go over them again. I'm not going to think about them. But because I know these risks, I know that every day I get to spend with her as precious because I really don't know what's going to happen. Come June 19th to a clock when they tell me it's over or it's over. And I just spend that time like, oh man, attachment, parenting, like that girl was never set down. She cried for nothing. She got fed and ever she wanted. She was ivy and we all loved her. And so, but every night I would think, I would play it through my head. I like to be prepared. And this is something I was not prepared for. And I, at night, I would think, what am I going to say to the doctor when he comes out and says, ivy did great. She's amazing. And I'll go, yes, she is. Where is she? Like, that's what I was going to say. But then I also ran through the possibility of like, crap, I'm going to have to tell her sisters, Avery and Eliza. I'm going to have to tell it she didn't make it. That's going to be really hard to do. And so, they, the surgery comes and we are prepared and we're ready. And eight hours later, eight hours, they're working on my baby. And they come out, or eight hours were waiting for the results of this cranial, reconstructive open suture, details, detailed, detailed surgery. And I'm just like ready for anything, you know. And the doctor or the nurse comes to the door and says, can ivy's parents come back here? And I watched TV and I know that that's not good. Because on TV, they come out. If it's good news, they pull you back if it's bad news. And so I get it from the chair and I'm like, I have to have that conversation with Avery and Eliza. I have to tell them their sister didn't make it. And I'm like, so sad about that. I can't even pay attention to the fact that I'm walking through the store and the surgeon comes down the hall and I'm like, where's the, where's the chaplain? I don't know what's going on. And he goes, ivy did great. No, no, no, ivy's over there. She's fine. I'm literally removing a cleft palate in the other room. But she's fine. And I'm like, you French Canadians. And I proceed to see ivy. And she's sitting on this huge table and she looks exactly the same. And I'm like, that was eight hours. And but little did I know she would continue to develop and the swelling would go down. But I was like, God, she's so beautiful. Man, she got prettier. What did you all do? You know? And they removed this towel and I see her scarf for the first time. And they weren't joking. And I was like literally from one ear, swirly line to the other ear. And it was thick and it was bloody and it was scary. But it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. And that night I got to stay with her in the pick you at Children's Hospital. And it was easily, easily the best day of my life. So in the next morning, the neurosurgeon comes in and says, hey, how's it going? And I'm like, something profound. Say something profound. She saved your daughter's life. Hey, that's all I said. And I said, what's going on? And she goes, I have you look great. And I said, yeah, I have a question. Why didn't you shave her hair? Like, she still has her hair. And she goes, oh, Dr. Sanjoleir, the plastic surgeon, he is such a sucker for little baby girls. He will do anything he can to not shave their hair. And he has like five daughters. So he gets it. I'm like, I don't know what he gets. But I was like, really? Like, he thought of that. Like, he was opening up my daughter's skull, touching her brain, completely changing the way she looked. And he thought about not shaving her hair. And so I think about Ivy's hair now and how it's growing and how it covers her scar that you can barely see anymore. And I'm like, man, if that hair could talk, it would tell literally the greatest story of the bravest girl in the world."
29,quietfire.wav," It's 1979 and summer in New York City. That was 38 years ago when I was being interviewed for promotion from Secretary to Coordinator of Daytime Casting at ABC. I wore my new silk blouse, matching slim skirt and two-inch yellow sling back heels. I thought I was ready, although there was some who thought I wasn't tough enough to hold onto a job like that. And somewhere in a tiny corner of my mind, there was a part of me that suspected fear that they might be right. I even had a secretary come up to me and say, fill us. You're too nice. And to which I responded, thank you. In any case, I was meeting a friend from lunch across the street before my two o'clock interview. And when I got there, I found hordes of people spending the length and the width of the sidewalk in front of the building, three people deep. But I found a gap, cut through it, and when I got into the center of this human oval, something came up behind me, grabbed me, prevented me from moving, pinning my arms to my sides. And I looked over both shoulders to see if I could find out what it was, but I didn't see anything. So I started to struggle. And the more I struggled, the tighter the grip became. And then I looked to the sea of faces for some clue, some information that would help me to understand what was holding me. What was going on? But they were just placidly chewing and eating their lunch and staring at me. Suddenly, the pressure was released and a set of rough hands grove to me in every part of my body and then pushed me in my lower back. I stumbled forward almost falling, but I regained my balance and I turned around to find a six foot mine leering at me. He was in full dress with the beret, the face paint, the polisher to suspend his black pants and the very comfortable sneakers. He was beckoning to me and slapping his behind, inviting me to hit him. And I took the bait. I wrapped the strap of my purse around my hand and I went after him and I swung. And as just as my purse was about to connect, he bounced to another side of the oval and leared at me again and beckoned me a second time and padded his behind and wagged it at me as an invitation to come and try again. And I did. And this time, I swung so hard that when he darted out of the wake, the momentum pulled me forward and I almost stumbled and fell. And then the people started to laugh and I was feeling like a real fool. So when he beckoned me for the third time, common sense prevailed. And then the limb skirt heals sneakers. I'm outmatched. You got it, I said. And I turned and walked away and tried to go up those stairs to get into the building when he rushed up behind me and grabbed my behind and squeezed it and then darted to safety down further in the oval. And people started to laugh. And I just stood there as waves of humiliation and rage ran through my body. And I finally got myself together, got up the stairs, got into the building, got to the cafeteria where they were serving my favorite turkey tetrazzini. And I went through the motions, paid for my food and sat at the table but I couldn't eat or speak. I had just been blindsided, bullied and blatantly violated by a strange man in the street with the approval of hordes of other strangers. And the thought that I had no way to protect or defend myself made me feel so powerless that I wanted to cry. So I just sat there. Then I remembered something that I might have at the bottom of my purse that I bought from a 99 cent store four months prior as a joke. And I started digging down into my purse and the minute my fingers touched that cold hard canister. I realized that I might have some options after all. I picked it up. I wrapped my napkin around it and I said, got a go and turned and got back outside to see if he was still there. And of course he was. And I worked my way to the front of the crowd because it had swollen to five people deep to see what he was up to. And just as I looked up, a beautiful blonde in a pretty red dress cut through the crap just as I had. And just as she was about to mount this terrace, he snuck up behind her. And as she raised one foot, he insinuated his way between her legs and stood up, essentially mounting her on his lower back like a rider on a horse. He reached under her dress, grabbed her legs and proceeded to gallop around the oval with this woman's hair flying, arms flailing, holding onto her purse while trying to keep from falling backwards. When he let her down, he promptly lifted her dress up over her head and held it there. To the hoots and the whistles of the men. And when he finally let her go, she staggered into the building and quickly disappeared. And I said to myself, is this 1979 in New York City or have I been dropped into the twilight zone? How could this be happening? Where are the police? And as I said that, this elderly gentleman tall handsome, this English man stepped into the oval with an old woman in tow. She was holding onto the back of his jacket and he strode over to the mine and she peered out at the mine cringed and darted back. And I said to myself, now what did he do to this old woman that would have her cringing at the sight of him? And sure enough, the old man started shaking his finger in the mine's face. And the mine fainted in a sense. The hands and shoulders went up in the air like he was the victim. And he put on this terrible sad face and mined crying. And someone in the crowd yelled, bo, bo, leave the mine alone. And the crowd picked up the chant. Oh, bo, leave the mine alone. And the old man looked up startled into the hostile, menacing eyes of the wolf pack, consisting of executives, clerks, messengers, a UPS driver, a postal employee, even a hot dog vendor, selling his food was enjoying this spectacle. And the old man shook his head sadly. And they took the old woman by the hand and led her out of the crowd. And that's when I got it. This was nothing but a big show. This was theater in the round. And every unsuspecting woman who cut through the crowd became a player whether she wanted to or not. She became the catch of the day on the mine's lunchtime menu, subject to any form of abuse he chose to cook up to fee vicariously the appetites of his patrons. And so when he started looking around for a new player, I stepped back into the human arena and waited. He spotted me. He came towards me. And as he got closer, his eyes narrowed. And I couldn't tell whether it was because of his recognizing me from before, from what he had done to me, or whether he was strategizing how he was going to launch this frontal attack, because his ammo was to play dirty pool and sneak up behind the woman and catch her off guard. But when he got two feet away, I lifted my can of pepper spray and I sprayed him in his face. Yes. And his eyes got wild and he reached for my throat and I took two steps back and I sprayed him again. And again. I sprayed him like a roach. And then he began to cough and wheeze and sneeze and he started staggering towards the street and his loyal patrons pardoned and let him go. He wound up on the hood of a park car and I stood there and enjoyed watching him wheeze and sneeze. And as I was doing that, something karate chopped my right hand. It's another mind. And this one is twice the size of the other one and this hulking galaeth of a man is glaring at me like he wants to kill me. And we both hear my canister rolling slowly but noisily down the sidewalk and he numbered towards it and I rolled around and I went after it and the two of us scrambled to get to that canister and I got there first and he moved towards me and I took a wide stance and I got all the way down and I started rocking and I said, do you want this motherfucker? Come and get it! He's the cold in his tracts and we looked at each other both knowing that if he ever got his hands on me he could break me into but that day I had had enough and seen enough pushing and grabbing and grouping. That day I was prepared to die and I wasn't leaving the planet alone. I was taken in with me! He must have seen it in the rocking or read it in my eyes because they were saying kill the mind because he backed up, turned around and disappeared back into that crowd. And by now the spray is starting to spread to his patrons and they are coughing and weasing and sneezing and quickly disperse without leaving a dime in his beret. So I dropped my canister back in my purse and I stood up only to realize that I had bent the heel on my shoe and I had split my seam on my skirt all the way up to my behind and I had an interview at two o'clock so I hobbled back across the street and I got on that elevator and got to my office and grabbed my scotch tape and my stapler. I rushed into the ladies room, locked the door, took off my skirt, turned it inside out and pinched that seam back together. I pinched and stapled and pinched and stapled until I got that whole thing closed. Then I taped down one side with the scotch tape and the other side and then one going straight down the center in the hopes that no one would ever know what had just happened across the street. I went to my desk and I reached in my bottom drawer for a pair of flats that I always keep there and put them on and waited for that call from personnel and when they called me I went upstairs, marched into that office and aced that interview and got the job. Oh yes, oh yes and that was the day that I got in touch with my other side. Now she doesn't make many appearances but she's available on an as-need basis and I call her my quiet fire and we both thank you."
30,thesecrettomarriage.wav," I am often asked if I am married. Sometimes I lie and say that I am. Sometimes I lie and say that I am not. Neither answer feels entirely truthful to me. If I say I am not married, the true answer, people occasionally try to set me up with their offspring. They seem to think I would be a great daughter-in-law. Actually, I would be a great daughter-in-law. I send thank-you cards. I am a terrific conversationalist. I can bake a pie. I met the man I am not married to the second week of college. You're wearing black, Hans said. I'm wearing black. This was said with some irony. We were standing in a black box theater. Everyone was wearing black. He had a girlfriend, so we didn't get together until several months later. We have been together ever since, 21 years. A year before I met Hans, a relative of his opened a credit card in his name and charged the better portion of another relative's wedding on it. And then she forgot to pay the bill for years, forever, actually. Hans didn't find out until two years after the crime when he was applying to graduate school. Even after making arrangements to pay off the debt, his credit was ruined and he couldn't get student loans. The credit card company told him the only way to clear his credit would be to take the relative to court. Identity theft is a serious crime, the company said, and she could possibly go to jail. Hans wouldn't do it because the woman had a child and he didn't want the child to grow up without a mother. I like that about him. He was in his early twenties, and less than poor. But what difference did it make? He was a person of integrity. And we were in love. We had been together six months. It can be awkward to describe the situation to people I don't know. They tend to ask follow-up questions. Why didn't you just clear the credit cards and then get married? Why didn't I? I say lightly. The answer is, many reasons, because I was 18 when I met him and didn't know how long the relationship would last, because it was a lot of money and I was embarrassed to ask my parents for help. Because neither of us had regular jobs and we both wanted to be artists more than we wanted to be married people. Because one of us need a good credit in order to rent apartments and charge groceries. Because by the time we had the means to make honest people of ourselves, we felt as if we had been together too long to bother. But I don't say these things. Don't you like weddings? Someone will ask, I love weddings. The odd mix of religion, government, and pageantry moves me. It's like theater, but with real people. I have been to weddings. I have seen the white dresses. I have worn the bridesmaid's dress. I have smelled the roses. I have never caught the bouquet, but I have watched its trajectory with enthusiasm. I have heard the wedding band play shout and I have gotten a little bit louder now. I have shopped the registries and I've sent the pasta makers, the towels, the knives, the losses. I am comfortable with the fact that as a person who has no plans to marry, I will not receive the pasta maker, the towel, the knives, or the vase in return. Hunts and I have been together a long time and for better or for worse, we have those things already. My accountant recently broached the subject of marriage with me. He has been my accountant for the last 13 years and I feel as if he's my second most important long-term relationship. We were discussing whether I should consider getting married now. I said, it feels like it's been too long. I guess because I'm turning 40 this year, he said, well, there are reasons to be married when you're old. The reasons fell largely into two categories. What happens when I die? And what happens if I get sick and then die? Once, on the way back from Japan, a customs agent was furious at Hans and me for sharing a checked suitcase when we weren't related. We were not family, which meant we needed to speak to customs separately. So, how to deal with the problem of a shared suitcase? What was a customs agent to do? Well, you see, I remember saying, when he was in college, a relative opened up this credit card and basically, this encapsulated the reason to get married at this peaceful midpoint of our lives. Because as you get old, per my accountant, life becomes a series of skirmishes with customs agents. I know he's right. At this point though, the math bothers me. I don't want to start over again at year one. I worry that if Hans and I were to get married now, it would somehow be like saying the last two decades didn't count. I have had four dogs with a man I am not married to. I have dedicated several of my books to him, but really they all could be. He is my most important reader and creative collaborator. We have traveled the world with one suitcase. We have cooked more than 100 blue apron meals without killing each other. We have shared a dozen different addresses. We have built a life. But we are not married. We live in California, which means we are not even common law-married. Some time ago, we had not been married for 15 years. When we had an apartment by Riverside Park in New York, Hans woke up, looked out the window and said, with boyish, almost biblical conviction, everything is telling me that's Kristen Shaw. She was on one of our favorite shows, the Flight of the Concords. We went down to walk our dog and the woman was still sitting in the park. It was not Kristen Shaw. It could not have been less Kristen Shaw. And now, we say this to each other all the time. Everything is telling me that's Kristen Shaw. It's amazing how often this can be worked into conversation. This won't be funny to anyone, but the man I am not married to. Our friends recently got divorced. They had been together as long as we had, and I had thought they were happy. But you can never know what goes on between two people. I asked her, what percentage of time would you say you were happy? 20%. She said. Several weeks later, she revised her estimate. Maybe 2%. Two, I said, how can a person live in a state of 2% happiness? Perhaps three, she revised again. Hans and I are happy together most of the time. We have the usual domestic squabbles. Our most frequent argument ends with him throwing up his hands and saying, I'm not a handyman. Sometimes I think the secret to a long and happy marriage is never to get married in the first place. Although, there are surely married couples that are as happy as we are. Not long ago, when a woman asked me the marriage question, I stumbled on what I believed to be the correct answer. I have been with the same man for more than two decades, but I am not sure either of us believes in marriage. I felt clever for stating my situation so concisely. Believe, she's golfed. Believe is for little children and Santa Claus. She was right. It's just words to say, I don't believe in marriage. Having stayed with a person for more than 20 years, I must believe in marriage. I must believe that life is better in a pair than it is single. When I say I don't believe in marriage, what I mean to say is this. I understand the financial and legal benefits, but I don't believe the government or church or a department store registry, can change the way I already feel and behave. Because when the law doesn't find you as a couple, you have to choose each other every day. And maybe the act of choosing changes a relationship for the better. But successful married people must know this already. I wake up in the morning and I look at Hans and I think, I love you. I choose you above any other person. I chose you 21 years ago and I choose you today. I believe you to be a constant in my life and I, a constant in yours. Loving you is the closest thing I have to face. Everything is telling me that's Christian Shaw."
31,escapingfromadirediagnosis.wav," When my best friend since childhood wound up back on the oncology unit for her third relapse, I decided it was time to start online dating. I knew from Nancy's prior hospitalizations that talking about lymphoma and pet scams was not her idea of fun. A far better entertainment would be for me to get on match.com, so we could hang out together on her hospital bed scrolling through potential dates. For 42 years, our friendship had been primary. We helped each other through every crisis. Her separation, my divorce, along with our everyday worries as mothers. Putting myself back on the dating market for her pleasure was the least I could do. It would be just like what we had done since our shared fourth grade crash on Tommy H. Having a blast checking out boys. But there was another reason. I had begun hearing myself say, this is not a dress rehearsal. This meaning our lives. After a divorce 22 years earlier in a long post marriage relationship, I had kept all potential romance light, which mostly meant dating charming but impossible men, not anyone with whom to spend the rest of my life. With Nancy's uncertain prognosis, the rest of my life took on new meaning. Let's do it, Nancy. You deserve a big love. Well, you don't deserve this, I said, as her doctor in a flock of medical students crowded into her room. Life's for the living, she said. Let's both get a new protocol for life. First, I needed to create a profile. The name I chose for myself. Darkbird 9. I understand the dark part, Nancy said, twirling my near black hair, and 9 is for your birthday. But what's up with the bird? She frowned to indicate it didn't sound alluring. I thought it gave me glamour and mystery I confessed. Maybe if you're hoping to date an ornus solidist, she said shaking her head. She and I composed a straightforward profile. No mention of beach walks, no glasses of fine wine. I said I was a book nerd despite Nancy claiming that nerd isn't a tantalizing word on a dating site. Right away, Nancy wanted me to wink at a cute and much younger guy. I'm not winking, I said, and I'm not going on dates with men 15 years younger. They conceded that that made practical sense, but it was far less of a vicarious thrill for her. Luckily, because thrills on the cancer unit were my immediate concern, messages piled up in darkbird 9's inbox. It was easy to weed out the unsuitable. Your perfect one man wrote, marry me. You'd look great in something silky, another declared. I didn't reply to the gentleman who wrote, I you want date and bring you to restaurant nice. It took discipline not to reconsider my ban on younger men, and not just because Nancy kept saying, this is bleak, Vic, as we scrolled through the age appropriate ones. There were punchy men who penned letters tinged with sad, rye hopefulness, and fit guys in tight cycling shirts who asked to take me out between a scuba trip to the barrier reef and training for a dryathlon in Utah. Their notes sounded erobic. Eventually, I scheduled myself for five dates in a week, one at lunch each day, followed by a debrief on the oncology unit. The next week, Nancy and I were sitting in an alcove on her floor. The Hudson River glimmering out the window. I was telling her how date number one had proposed a second date as we finished our cop salads. As someone who had been online dating for months, he had assured me that our date was pretty much perfection. A chemo drip in her arm, Nancy said, you don't have to sleep with him, but would you go out again? Perfectly nice, I said, but he's not for me. In fact, the whole dating game seemed more and more like a pathetic diversion. Let me look at him again, she said, tilting the screen. I clicked on his profile. Oh, what were we thinking, she said, wind sing? Show me tomorrow. By Wednesday, I stumbled back to the hospital exhausted from my whirlwind dating wife. Tuesday had been a double header, lunch with one man, coffee with another. One asked if he could call from his business trip so we could keep the momentum going. You're a dating success, Nancy said. But her boast had no oomph. She was exhausted too. We were both trying to keep the charade going. She was tortured by the recurrence of her illness by being pulled out of her life again, stuck in a hospital and made into a full-time patient. It seemed beyond wrong that I deserved anything, let alone a great love while she once again lost her hair and prepared to endure stem cell transplant. So it was with zero expectations that I waited on a restaurant stoop and soho the next day for Mr. Thursday. My plan, another quick salad, and onto the subway. A friend would be joining Nancy me to hang out for the afternoon and evening. Suddenly, a pair of red sneakers appeared beside me on the stoop. I looked up and… Oh, a wonderfully present-in-handsome face smile down at me. Hey, he said. I'm Bruce. Within moments at a back table, we were laughing, talking books and children. He was smart, curious and beyond funny, with pale blue-green eyes and a naughty smile, ridiculously cute, and sexy, ridiculously. This is really great, I said, shyly returning from the bathroom. Yeah, we're set with a shrug. It's a great room. When I told Nancy about this moment, she gasped and said, no, no. Exhibiting that same protective disappointment is when my high school crush rejected me. As if she couldn't imagine someone not falling for her best friend? Exactly, I said. First guy I actually like and he's clearly not feeling it. I paused to elevate the drama. But 20 minutes later, he announces, I wasn't expecting lunch to go like this at all. That's what I was saying, I say. I know, he says, with a crooked smile, when I got a little freaked out. Vic, this is the one, and it said, radiating a love and certainty that I have basked in since I was eight. Her face, when I knew better than my own, offered absolute confidence. Trust me, she said, holding my hand. This is the one. There was an ex-state with Bruce and another. And by the time Nancy left the hospital, her lymphoma and remission in a stem cell transplant scheduled, she had proclaimed that I had found my real match. She was right. I was falling in love with him, open to what might be possible. But soon, the joy of shaping a life with Bruce began to feel like betrayal. How could I fall in love at 50 while my best friend struggled to hold onto her life? After a successful stem cell transplant, months of post-transplant quarantine, a hopeful year and a half of health, the disease returned, along with new protocols and terrible side effects. Often it felt impossible to create a future with Bruce when Nancy's life was increasingly compromised. And yet, we did. It seemed in congruence that our hospital dating game eventually led to the day, 18 months later that I called her to say, Bruce and I are getting married. I told you, Nancy, I had to tell you what happened. Now tell me everything. I took a long breath and began because I forget to dress for her, so I don't know if I deserved it. This was life. And because telling each other everything is what we had done since we were girls and would continue to do until we could it. Now as I wake each morning to a cup of coffee from Bruce and his hilarious morning one log, I remember how Nancy helped me find this late life surprise. And how Bruce's strong, clear love helped me through the darkness of losing my best friend. Life is for the living, Nancy would say. My life hard at Bruce's wicked humor because it feels so good to laugh. And because I would do anything for Nancy. Even make a life of true happiness without her there to share it."
32,mybackseatviewofagreatromance.wav," My plan was to go to Morocco to escape romance, not learn lesson in it. I've been awarded a prestigious research grant and the year-long stint in Ocean Away seemed the perfect excuse to finally break up with my sort of boyfriend. Though we lived on opposite coasts, this boyfriend type person and I had been together for more than two years and I'd been fighting at the whole time. Being a girlfriend seemed so old fashioned, well, and besides it made me behave in ways I disapproved of. I needed him in my life and I was into that fact. In my early 20s wasn't I supposed to be careless and uncommitted. With the trip looming, we decided, at my urging, to break up for real this time. I thought I would feel liberated. Instead I spent my days moaning around the house, crying or baking to distract myself from crying. I forced myself to remember that, well, this was exactly what I wanted. After all, love was so flimsy when held up against virtues like independence and freedom. So why did it feel like a vestigial arm, something fused on to me that I couldn't get rid of no matter how hard I tried? In the end, the breakup didn't stick and we left things ambiguous. My first night Morocco, I lay in a narrow hotel bed and I listened to the Russian sounds outside, even the traffic noise sounded fresh and thrilling. I envisioned days spent exploring markets and conducting research, deliciously independent. Instead, I became addicted to cynical peace corps volunteers, none of whom stuck around from more than a week or two. At night when loneliness enveloped me, I would Skype the unboyfriend. I was never good at figuring out the time difference, but he answered my calls, even at 5am. As a distraction, I threw myself into my research. I had come to Morocco to study first-generation literacy in teenage girls. And a contact suggested that I begin work in Am's mezz, a small town at the foothills of the Atlas Mountains. Not far from my home base in Marrakesh. The family I stayed with there was poor, even by the standard of that rural town. And still, they were amazingly welcoming. Fatsumizora, at 20, was the oldest daughter, and she soon adopted me as her special charge. After tour of the town, Fatsumizora took me to her favorite spot, the hill, dotted with scrappy goats and glum-looking cows. We talked about school, cooking, hairstyles, and Jackie Chan. She was a very big fan. After a lull in the conversation, she looked up at me shyly, and I had a feeling I knew it was coming. Are you in love? She asked. The last two words in English. She preferred English for most love words. She had clearly been studying all those romantic comedies that I had studiously avoided. I tried to convey my answer. Well, I don't know. Probably not. I mean, what is love, really? In the awkward mix of friend Shineribik, that was our means of communication. And at the time, I thought it was my butchered language that disappointed her. Now I wonder if she did understand me, and it was my dithering that left her cold. What about you, I asked, not expecting much of an answer. As far as I could tell, she was a shy girl who rarely left the house, and the relatively strict gender segregation meant that Um's mes was hardly a hotbed for teenage romance. I have a friend she said, and from the way she said it, blushing wildly, and they would have looked me in the eye. Well, it was clear that she was far more certain about this friend than I was about my boyfriend type person. Over the next day or two, she told me all about him. Jawad drove a grand taxi, which meant that he traveled a fixed route between Am's mes and a tinier town, about 20 kilometers away. Fatima Zura had run literacy classes in that town, and had come to know Jawad as a weakly commute. Moroccan grandtaxes typically squish about six passengers plus a driver into a regular size sedan. So, they never had much privacy. Somehow though, they had come to an understanding. And no, her parents did not know. They would never approve. She asked if I would help her see him, and of course I agreed. I was all for the drama of an illicit rendezvous, especially when it wasn't mine. That evening, according to the plan concocted by Fatima Zura and her sister, Ahmel, I insisted that Fatima Zura escort me to the town's ramshackle internet cafe so I could check my email. It sounded a little far-fetched, but apparently the idea of an internet addicted American was believable enough to buy us an hour or two of unsupervised time. We immediately headed for an isolated road where Jawad knew to meet us. When he finally arrived in his battered white taxi, the son had begun to set. He leaned his head out the window and waved wildly. He had impish eyebrows and a grin just as big as Fatima Zura's. If not bigger. I decided I approved of the match. I climbed into the back seat and we sped off. Before long, Jawad turned onto a dirt path and he parked in the middle of a field, dotted with wildflowers. I was wondering whether we'd be going on a walk in the woods when, without further ado, the canoodling commenced in the front seat. My assumptions about Fatima Zura's sheltered life have been way off. That morning, I never would have predicted that my demure, he job-wearing friend would sneak away to make out in her boyfriend's car. Curled up in the back seat, I pretended to be interested in the scenery. But years of living in a tiny house with no doors, it must have been near to Fatima Zura from embarrassment. She giggled and snuggled in the front as if I weren't there at all. I eventually relaxed and I allowed myself to snoop. They were cute, absurdly so. Jawad seemed like a tender type. A forehead kisser, a cheek crosser. He kept going, she'd tickled him. They brought their heads together and whispered romantic things. Love Lauren Lebanese, pop singers moaned on the radio. And outside, the evening flickered with fireflies. It was way too adorable to be true. But here it was, happening right before my eyes. About half an hour of PG-rated nuzzling, it was time to head back. The brief visit made Fatima Zura giddy for the rest of the weekend. And I was pleased to play the role. As our internet cafe ploy became routine over several months, I found myself in the strange position of being not just a shop-roan but a secret advocate for romance. I kept waiting to be soured by all the longing and adoration. But this love stuff was increasingly addictive. My visit to Amzmes became something to look forward to. And I was happy to obsess over each delicious nuance with Fatima Zura and her sister. The best were the taxi cab evenings. Dates I could attend, but did not have to participate in. Despite my newfound begrudging appreciation of love, things with the unboyfriend were as prickly as ever. I did not want to lose my most loyal collar, my secret keeper, my funny friend. But I did not want to be with him either. So I vacillated. I was unfair. I said, cool things. And then I would call him crying when the next wave of loneliness hit. Things seemed to be going well in Amzmes until one day in April. When a man at a cafe spotted Fatima Zura and Jawad looking cozy and reported it to her father. Though generally an easygoing man, he blew up at the news. When Fatima Zura claimed she wanted to marry Jawad, he insisted that it was impossible. She was too beautiful to be married off to such a poor man. She needed someone who would provide a better life for her and her family. You can't feed yourself with love, he shouted. But you can't buy love. She shouted back. And after that, she was under virtual house arrest. Worse, she didn't see or speak to Jawad for two weeks. And well, she was afraid that he would forget her. I worried that someone would notice my sudden lack of interest in the internet cafe. But the family was too listless to even care. The situation was resolved in a spectacular manner. On a day when Fatima Zura's father had traveled to Marrakech for work, Achmal had a seizure. There was no money in the house and no way to take her to the doctor. Panic, Fatima Zura called Jawad, who swooped to the rescue, delivering the family to the hospital and even spending his own meager salary on the necessary medications for her. His white night act immediately endeared Jawad to the family. And Fatima Zura's father agreed to their engagement. If I had seen it in a movie, I would not have believed it. Hearing it recounted by Fatima Zura, I'm like cried. After that, things changed. Fatima Zura was busy planning her engagement party. She developed a swift and exclusive friendship with Jawad's sister. And now it was usually the two of them conferring in a corner about womanly things. I spent most of my time back in Marrakech, lonely, in a different way than I had been at the arrival eight months before. At least I had overcome my ambivalence to the cliches of love. But what did it mean that the most romantic thing I'd ever been a part of hadn't even happened to me? Ordinarily, I would have called the unboyfriend so he could talk me through it. But somehow, I knew I would have to handle this alone. For weeks, I turned over the problem in my head before admitting what had to be done. Diling the unboyfriend's number, I held the image of Fatima Zura and Jawad beaming at each other in the taxi, wholeheartedly sure of each other. And when I told the unboyfriend we needed to end things, he became very quiet. Something in my voice must have told him that it was real this time. In a way, it was my own version of the grand romantic gesture. The best way I knew to honor love, there was still something between us, friendship, inside jokes, a closeness, born of many crises suffered together. But whatever we had, it was unfair to call it love."
33,myfirstdaywiththeyankees.wav," I grew up a huge fan of the New York Yankees, which when I was very small involved going to games, maybe once a year with my father, my little brother watching Reggie Jackson, a little bit older watching. Dave Winfield and then when I kind of came into my teens, nomadingly, who was my absolute favorite player. And as I went to high school in New York and it was kind of a turning point the first time that I went to Yankee game by myself and I started going to Yankee games by myself and it was one of these games in the fall of 1991 that I went up to the stadium and bought a ticket to the bleachers and went and sat in the bleachers and was watching. The game and noticed for the first time something that I'd been to the stadium so many times before, but I'd never seen this kid in Rightfield wearing a Yankee uniform who was a back-boy playing catch with the Rightfielder and I'd never noticed the back-boy before and this kid could not play catch his life. He was throwing the ball over. Jesse Barfield's had the Rightfielder and he was one hopping him and I was like, you know, I'm not a great athlete but I can play catch at least as well as this kid can and I don't understand why he has that job and I couldn't. So I went home that night and I tore a page out of the program that listed all the different Yankee executives and I wrote a handwritten letter to everyone from Steinbrenner on down to Stunt Merrill who was the manager at that point and basically said, you know, my name is Matt and I'm 16 years old and I'm a huge fan of the Yankees and you know, I don't know if you can apply for this back-boy position but if you can I really would like an application and I'm so excited to hear from you that if I don't hear from you soon I'm going to follow up with a phone call. So, Senthia's off in about two weeks went by and after, you know, two weeks I hadn't heard anything and so I picked up the phone and this Yankee switchboard number was on the same list of executives and Secretary asked for the phone hello New York Yankees and I said hi this is Matt McOff and I sent a letter in a couple weeks ago about applying for a back-boy position and nobody got back to me. So she is like, okay well take your name down and I'll have somebody get back to you and took my number down and another week goes by and I don't hear anything so I pick up the phone again and I call on this woman answers the phone hello New York Yankees and I say hi this is Matt, you know, sent some letters in about the back-boy position and I called last week and somebody was supposed to call me back but, you know, I thought it was kind of rude that they had him and so she, you know, she laughed and she asked me how old were you and I said 16 and she laughed some more and I didn't really understand what she was laughing at but, you know, she took down my name again and she said, you know, I'll make sure that somebody gets back to you so, you know, a few days later sure enough in the mail a letter arrived on Yankee, letterhead official letterhead and inviting me to come up to the stadium for an interview with Nick Priori who's the club ass manager so I put my jacket and tie on and I don't even think I told any of my friends about this because it was way too weird to explain so I went up, took the four train up to the stadium and walked into the, you know, walked around the stadium and this is October so they weren't playing in the royal series in October back in 91 so it was very, very quiet and I walked around the stadium and walked into the Yankee lobby and there's a security guard there and I introduce myself and I say I'm here for the Bapoy interview and he picks up the telephone and he's like, you know, Nick some kids here to see you and, you know, okay, so he says, you know, have a seat so I sit down and the pins drive lobby and I'm, you know, passing about 10 minutes waiting for this guy Nick to come up for the first job interview of my life, for the first job of my life and I'm, you know, trying to think of the questions that he might ask me so I'm ready to tell him what my favorite subject is in school and tell him, you know, why I think the Yankees need a big bat behind Matting Lake, you know, to win the pen and next year and what, you know, Mickey Mantle's batting average was in 1956 and like all these different questions so, you know, I'm kind of passing the time and these double doors burst open and this guy walks in obviously Nick but he doesn't introduce himself, he's, you know, could be anywhere from 40 to 80 years of age. He has this greased back hair and he has a stogie between the two teeth left in his mouth and a chopped tobacco possibly also and this wifebeater t-shirt and Yankees shorts and white athletic socks pulled up to his knees and he's shoe polished, like black sneakers that are obviously shoe polished and he just looks at me and says, are your parents going to mind you taking the train home late at night? So I'd say, you know, I take the train to school every day I think I think it'll be fine and he just kind of looks at me and finally I say, no, I don't think my parents will mind me taking the train home late at night and he says, we'll come back opening day so that was October, you know, I go home, I think I have the job. I'm not really sure and you know six months later opening day in 1993, I show up at 9 a.m. I put on my jacket and tie, I walk back to the stadium, I go back downstairs, you know, through these tunnels and come to this, you know, big steel door that says Yankee Club outside and I walk inside and it's complete pandemonium and you know, there's these ball players that I'd only seen before on TV or across rows and rows of stadium seats and like they're there in the flesh and in front of me and don't madingly is over, you know, on the right and I had a poster of don madingly above my bed, you know, for my whole life and he's standing right over there and Jimmy Key, the ace of the pitching staff is over there and all these guys and, you know, opening day Yankee Stadium is not just a sports event, it's a news event, it's the beginning of spring and in New York and Mayor Dinkins is there with his entourage and just Mayor Dinkins and I'm adding like, you know, it's so you know, I'm walking around and just kind of lost and I figure, you know, I better go find Nick so I walk up to Nick and I say Nick, what do you, you know, what do I'm mad, we met a couple months ago, what do you, what do you want me to do, it's my first day of work, so he says stay that f out of my way, so I kind of like shrink back and throw my backpack over on the side and just kind of wander around in the days and I feel a tap on my shoulder and I turn around and it's not madingly and he sticks his hand out and he says, how's it going, I'm not madingly, are you going to be working with us this year? Which, you know, even at that moment, I'd never really thought about the experience in those terms and he could have said so many other things that wouldn't have been as cool as that, like you could have said, you know, are you, who are you, are you the new Batboy, are you going to be working for us this year, but he said, you know, I'm not madingly, are you going to be working with us this year? So I said, I know you are, Mr. Maddenly, I'm mad, I'm the new Batboy and he's like great to meet you, Matt. I have a very big very big job to ask of you, I've just unpacked all my bats from spring training and I don't know if it was the altitude of the flight from Florida or the humidity down there or what, but the game starts in about two hours and I need you to find me a bats treacher. So I say, okay, so I go, I go and find Nick and I go, you know, Nick is busy, probably half a dozen ball players are like bothering him for double A batteries or, you know, my hat sizes, my hat's too small or this or that and I go up and I'm like, Nick, I need a bats treacher from Matt and he lets loose with a stream of exploits that fell on, I swear, a completely version of yours, like I never, never heard that type of language in the movies before or anywhere, let alone direct it at me. So I kind of like rock back on my heels and go and find somebody I can trust, like Nick's assistant Rob and I ask him, you know, I need a bats treacher from Matt and I lay and Nick told me to go f myself and I don't know what to do. So he was like chill out, you know, I saw Danny Tartable using one in his locker. So Danny Tartable is the, you know, power heading right fielder. I go to his locker and he's getting dressed in his uniform and I stand off on the side and he says, you know, how's it going? And I'm like fine, I'm mad at him, the dupe batboy and the bats treacher for Don Mattingland, I heard you were just using one. So he's like, well, I was using one but I left it in the manager's office, you should probably go check in there. So I say thanks and he says see you around and I go into the manager's office and walk in and buck show all through the manager is having a press conference with probably like 8 or 10 reporters and I stand off on the side and I'm kind of, you know, the conversation comes to a stand still basically because there's a 16 year old kid there in his Easter blazer and jacket and standing in the manager's office in Yankee Stadium two hours before first pitch on opening day looking very lost and very anxious and show all through turns to me and he's like, can I help you? And I say, I'm mad I'm the dupe batman's really sorry to interrupt but I need a bats treacher for Don Mattingland Danny Tartable says that he left it in here so show all through looks now like beneath this desk and you know he's like, well, you know, do you need a right-handed one or a left-handed one? So this is the first moment all day that I actually, you know, this is the first question that I had that I could answer with complete confidence because you couldn't have grown up in New York at that time, you know, without knowing that Mattingland was the best left-handed hitter in baseball so I say, if I need a left-handed bats treacher. So he's like, well, I think we maybe have a right-handed one around here but probably not a left-handed one and like you should try it out with the Red Sox Clubhouse and see if they have one. So I say, okay, thanks. You know, I'm sorry to interrupt. I go out at this point I'm like sprinting down the hallways like the tunnels beneath the stands, the first-based stands at the stadium and I run into the Red Sox Clubhouse and find their equate manager and give him like the whole story. I'm at him. The new bad boy for the Yankees and Danny Tartable left his right-handed bat treacher and I'm in box-shoulders office and he left-handed one and like the game's about to start and he's like calm down like, you know, we don't have one but we need one. Like here's 20 bucks. Go up to the sporting store on 160 First Street and River Avenue and buy two. Like by a left-handed one for Mattingland and a right-handed one for us and then bring me back to change. So he gives me the 20. I put it on my pocket. I run upstairs, you know, at this point it's like an hour before opening day. The fans are coming down like 50,000 fans are coming down from, you know, the subway in the opposite direction that I'm walking. I'm the only person in the world who knows that, you know, if I don't come through on this mission, Mattingland is going to go up there against Roger Clemens and the Red Sox on opening day Yankees stadium with a toothpick in his hand, basically. So I'm like fighting against the crowd and feeling so much weight on my shoulders and I make my way, you know, and I'm about to cross the threshold of stand sporting goods when it dawns at me like I've played a lot of baseball in my life and I've, you know, been a big fan for a while and like I don't even know what a bad stretcher looks like. And at the moment that I'm like walking into the store it dawns at me for the first first time like is this a joke? Like could this possibly be a joke? And if it, you know, but I've had so much fear because like if it is a joke and I go back and I tell Don Mattingland, you know, I'm too smart to fall for your, you know, your BS bad stretcher story and I'm wrong. I'm going to be back in the bleachers like before my first game, you know, and lose my dream job. So, you know, I take three laps around the stadium kind of convincing myself like it's got to be a joke, like it's got to be a joke and I, you know, I walk back in, I go down the stairs, I walk into the clubhouse, Mattingland winks at me from across the clubhouse, I couple of other ball players laugh. Mattingland goes three for five that day. Yankee's went, it was my first day in pinstripes and, you know, I didn't learn until later on that I was the first kid in anyone's memory to have gotten the job without having a connection without, you know, somebody knowing somebody or my dad knowing somebody or whatever, which was, you know, a lesson, a lesson in itself and, you know, is intensely naive. My pursuit of that job was, you know, I was probably as naively intense in chasing the bad stretcher, but, you know, the lesson in the story is, you know, when there's with a great deal of persistence and a little bit of common sense, even if the thing you're chasing may not exist, you can sometimes will it into being. Thank you."
34,tildeath.wav," It was five days before my tenure high school reunion. When my husband told me he thought he might be gay. He wasn't sure he was gay because he had never been with a man yet. But he thought it was something he ought to figure out. Good idea. Now, I think he told me this at that moment, not to get out of my high school reunion, which would be understandable. But in order to, because we've been looking for houses together, and we'd finally found one in Pasadena that we both liked. And I think somehow, the forever of a wedding vow sounded kind of vague and idealistic to him, where his 30-year mortgage was surprisingly specific. It was a commitment. The kind of commitment you shouldn't make while your sexuality is pending. Now, as he was explaining this to me, I was thinking downstairs, our neighbors, we living this duplex apartment. We were renting the coffins. We're probably just sitting down to dinner as they'd done for 52 years and talking about their briskit. And they were this couple that used to come up and see our new furniture when we bought a new antique table, because Sam liked antique shopping. And pink flag. So they were like parent figures to us. And there were signs. When I first met Sam, he had this leather jacket with Tiger Print lining. And I remember thinking, it seemed kind of the lining. I don't know. It stuck with me. And then he asked me out and we slept together. And he asked me to marry him. And I put on the big white dress, which he helped me pick out. And Frank, seriously, in front of 200 closes friends, and I figured he's not. And also, I guess there was one thing I ignored, which I probably should have paid attention to. Before we were engaged, he told me he sometimes noticed men. But he said he couldn't imagine sleeping with a man. And he just noticed them. And I guess I knew this was not good, because I didn't talk to any girlfriends about this. And I talked to girlfriends about everything. So if I didn't, it was probably bad. But at one point, I did talk to one girlfriend. We were in line at Disneyland for Space Mountain. And I told her how Sam had said he sometimes noticed men. And she said, she told me the theory of the spectrum of sexuality and everyone lies somewhere along it. And some people noticed people, but they would never act on it. And well, four years later, she realized she was a lesbian. So my one person I confess to. So as I was recalling all these signs, I realized Sam was still talking. And he was telling me he felt so much better getting this office chest and he'd be wanting to tell me for a long time. And he felt so relieved. He kind of wanted to have sex. And I said with who? He said with you. And I think he meant it as a compliment, but I have to go to bed and wake up when the book stores are open. So the next day, I went directly to the self-help section where all problems could be solved. And there was no book for someone who's has been thought he might be gay. There was a book called Loving Someone Gay, but it turned out to be for teachers and family members. But nothing. And I was nervous because this is LA. And I didn't want to pioneer a problem. This is a very bad sign. And as I'm looking for a book, any book, I remember I saw one called How to Survive Alien Abduction. And it wasn't a humor book. It was a serious book with things like block their mind control and get help from on high. And so basically, according to the laws of supply and demand, you're more likely to be abducted by an alien. And to have your husband realize he's gay, that's what that said to me. And so I left the self-help section despondent and decided that it was time to go to therapy four days now for my high school reunion. So I went for the first time. I had never gone to therapy. I grew up in Oklahoma, which is where my reunion was going to be. And there was this thing called the gold group, because I was in the writer's guild. Basically, when I became a comedy writer, I decided my husband no longer wanted to be a straight man. That was basically what happened there. So I was in the writer's guild. And they paid for this. This is true. They paid for this thing called the gold group. And it was a group of therapists in the valley. And it was only a $10 copay. And it's possible you shouldn't skimp on therapy. But I thought I was going to be in for a while. So I went to the gold group. And I remember when I got in there, you basically get what you copay for, because I was in this office waiting for my therapist. And I could hear the session next to me. It was this paper saying, wow. And I could hear a man sobbing. And I was like, they're going to hear me sobbing. And then when my therapist came in, she turned on this little oscillating fan, which I think is the system the gold group had come up with, to deal with the soundproofing problem. And my therapist, and I didn't have anything to compare against. But I just remember noting she was very badly dressed, like pink and red together and stripes. And I thought she can't put together an outfit. And she has to put together my whole life. This is not good. And she had all these questions I hadn't even thought of. Do you think you should be HIV tested? And maybe he's lying. And he's been cheating on you. And she had a lot of anger that we worked on. She felt better. OK, so I proceeded. My decision was to go to the reunion with Sam and pretend everything was fine. Because it seemed better than, well, one problem was Sam wasn't ready to come out, because he hadn't started. See, when he told me he thought he might be gay, he said, maybe I'll only be 30% gay, I'll find out. And then I could still be with you. And I was overwhelmed at the moment. But I do remember thinking, so he'll sleep with 10 men and enjoyed three of them. I'm confused how we're going to do the math of this. So he hadn't started that experiment yet. So he wasn't ready to come out, because he didn't know yet. So we just went to my reunion like that. So we stayed with my parents, which is not a fun thing, even when your husband doesn't think he might be gay. And I remember at the reunion, I won most successful. And I just was like, yeah, my husband's gay. So I was Oklahoma. The runner up was like the manager of the footlocker. So it wasn't a huge honor. But anyway, I remember when I went home, I was really nervous about my mom. Because my mom, it was like being, you know, that scene in my for Lady when the linguistic experts asked her to dance. That's how it was being alone with my mom, with this secret. Because my mom, like right now, she would say, your voice sounds a little tight, honey. She's very eagle eye about these emotional things. And I kept worrying and trying to avoid her. And I completely forgot about my dad. And at one point, he was sitting there watching ESPN. And he said, is everything OK? And I said, no, if everything was OK, Sam would be in here watching ESPN with you instead of in the kitchen flipping through a house beautiful with mom. And I basically told my dad everything, which is not the system in my house. You tell my mom and my mom tells my dad, but I told my dad. And then I remembered why I don't ever tell my dad because he was like, he thought it was as if Sam was asking permission to have an affair. And I should just say no. So in fact, his words were, I'd like to sleep with Debbie Reynolds, but your mom's not going to let me. I was like, what if you wanted to sleep with Bert Reynolds? And to his credit, he had no experience with this. In college, he had had one, there was one guy in his fraternity that everyone knew had realized he was gay and left his wife and kids, Jerry Hobbleman, and no one had ever heard from him. Again, that was like his whole experience with the gay population. So he was no help. And somehow, though, Sam and I survived my high school reunion, but Mr. Kaufman, who lived downstairs, did not survive the weekend. He had died in a sleep of a heart attack, and there was a funeral. And I remember it was kind of a highlight for me because I had been crying in such inappropriate places all week. And finally, I was at a funeral. And I could just sob, even though I think it was odd to people because they were like, is she the tenant? Because I was kind of losing. I'm grabbing Kleenex from the mother. But I remember I was there with Sam, and we were holding hands. And we were thinking, I was thinking, at least at a funeral, there's a body and a grave and something tangible to mark the end. And with the relationship, it's never so clearly marked. And it was a relief to be there with Sam for closure. And then at being a Jewish funeral, there was a need for a minion where they needed ten men to go. And I remember thinking, don't go with the men to Sam. I do not want to go with the men. But then finally, I said, go. And I realized I meant it in the largest sense possible. And about a week later, my dad called me. And he said, you know, it's a really 99% genetic, this whole homosexuality thing. And I was completely thrown and thought maybe he'd been on the internet and researching. And it turned out that my dad had called Jerry Holleman and asked him to lunch. He had tracked down this man and took him to Denny's. And I'm sure there were lots of disclaimers, because my dad does not take men to lunch. So he probably was afraid it would sound like a date or something. And I'm sure when he showed up in shorts and black dress socks and loafers, it was clear he was not of the gay persuasion. But he asked Jerry all the things he wanted to ask. And couldn't, like, could you have avoided this and did you ever regret it? And is your wife OK? And it was maybe the nicest thing a father ever did, taking Jerry Holleman to lunch. And just about a week after that, Sam was finally moving out. And I remember we were in the top floor of our duplex in downstairs, Mrs. Kaufman was gardening, like she always did. And Sam hadn't talked to her yet, because she was like a parent figure, and he still wasn't ready to come out. And he wasn't dealing with things as he hadn't dealt with many things. And so I said, you have to tell her, because the moving event is going to be here any minute, and she's going to wonder. And he wouldn't. So I went downstairs to talk to her. And I remember she always loved gardening, but she seemed more desperate than ever to kind of keep things alive, nurture the living things, and not to let things slip away. And she couldn't imagine why I was letting my husband slip away. And I couldn't explain to her. And so we just sat together on this bench, shoulder to shoulder, to women alone, but not really alone, as the moving van lumbered over to the sidewalk. Thank you. APPLAUSE"
35,penpal.wav," I was overseas not that long ago on a business trip. And my last evening there, we all went out and by then everyone was sick and tired of talking about work. So we drank and we talked about other things like kids and families. And this guy Vlad says that his nine year old daughter, Julie, has an assignment in her English class to find a penpell. And he asked if my son Joseph would be willing to correspond with her. And I said, sure, because of course he would. Then I fly back home to New York and I tell Joseph, and Joseph says no. And he wouldn't say why, but I figured it must be because Julie is a girl. And Joseph is 11 and the way they teach them in school is romantic love is not a part of the curriculum yet. But on the other hand, they are already taught about abstinence and how sex leads to pregnancy and so additional responsibilities. So if Joseph came to associate girls with additional responsibilities and would last play time as a consequence, like last time for his playstation, I can't blame him for that, but what am I gonna do? I don't wanna break the promise that I don't ready me to Vlad. So I thought how hard can it be? I'll do it. And I went to Yahoo and I opened another email account there and I forwarded it to Vlad and I wrote to him that yes, Joseph would be happy to be Julie's pen bell. And I checked that mail box a few times in the week that followed and it was empty and I thought maybe I was off the hook. And then one night I came home late and I lived by myself. So I checked my match.com messages first and then I went to this new email account and there was an email there from Julie and I read it and I thought yeah, I can do this because she wasn't asking me any difficult questions. She wasn't asking what I learned from the past relationships. She wasn't asking what my true intentions are. She wasn't asking if I'm really divorced or just separated. All she wanted to know was, do I have a path, what my favorite color is and who I wanna be when I grow up? But an hour later I still didn't have an answer because what was it gonna say? That it would be nice to make Senior Vice President by the time I'm 40. That the reason I don't have a path is because I dread the thought of coming home one night and finding it on the floor. That I've just gone over every color of the rainbow only to conclude that each color has some sort of an unpleasant memory. Can I have to do it? I was hard to concentrate, it was late. I wasn't fully sober. My match that comes screen kept blinking because somebody without a photo wanted to chat. But I try to remember how would have answered Julie's questions years ago. So I ended up writing to her that my favorite color is blue because it's the color of the ocean and I have a parrot and when I do my homework my parrot is sitting on my shoulder. And when I grow up I wanna be a sea captain and my parrot and I will sail around the world. And when I walk up the next morning I turn on my computer and this is usually when I check my match.com messages again. But this time I was more interested in what Julie had to say about that whole sea captain thing. Then in the messages that I had waiting for me from my adult female open minded easy going down to earth outgoing and adventurous pen pals that were written in response to the very adult messages that I sent to them. And there was an email in that mailbox and I felt nervous about opening it and I opened it and it wasn't from Julie, it was spam. Something about signing up to have affairs with married women or signing up to find out if your wife is having an affair. Something like that. But I kept checking for new mail almost, almost hourly that day. And in between checking for new mail I asked myself all kinds of questions like, okay so you want it to be a sea captain and then what happened? And I remembered telling my parents that I wanna be a sea captain and my mom said, she's not a way of too many sea captains who are Jewish. And my grandma said, what about Christopher Columbus? He was a Jew. And I remember everybody looking at my grandma not saying anything because pretty much anything my grandma said was ignored because she kind of lost her standing in the family ever since she was seen crying at President Brezhnev's funeral. And my dad said that Christopher Columbus doesn't count because he had converted. And my other grandma who always argued with my mom, no matter what the topic she said, what about her cousin's husband who was an accountant for a cruise line? And my mom said, it's not the same thing. And my grandfather said that it has no about captains but what he does know is that TV repairs is a pretty damn good business to be in. And he said that one should look no further than his nephew Alek. And his nephew Alek was a TV repairman. He visited us every couple of months whenever our old TV broke. And he walked around with this beat up old rectangle of briefcase filled with spare parts and all shapes and sizes. And he always looked like he was tired all the time. And I was remembering all of these things and I remember how I was dreaming about standing on the bow of a ship with a sun in my face and with the wind in my face and the ocean wave splashes in my face. And I thought that so much has changed since then because now if I'm thinking about being in a ship, I see myself walking up and down the deck of some cargo ship anchored somewhere in the vicinity of Stet Nylon in a fog with nothing but those old rastage shipping containers around me. And how lonely it probably feels. And so I kept waiting for Julie's message. And nothing was coming from her. And about a week later, Vlad called with some more questions. And then he said that he was really, really sorry. But Julie didn't want to be Joseph Spentail anymore. And I said, why? And he said he didn't know why. And I thought maybe it's because he didn't ask her any questions. And Vlad asked me if I read Joseph's mail. And I said, no. So he read it to me over the phone. And then he said that Joseph would probably very upset if he didn't hear from Julie again. And I don't know what made me sad that say that yes, he probably would be. And Vlad said that if Julie wasn't going to write to Joseph, then he wouldn't. And I said, I told him not to worry about it. But I must have sounded really upset because he said that no. He'll write to him. Only he wanted me to tell him what to write. So I said, I'll think about it. And a week later, he called to remind me and I was in the middle of something. And I looked at this postcard from Florida that I had in my cubicle. And I said, oh, how about this? Dear Joseph, my favorite color is also blue. And my favorite animal is the dolphin. And when I grow up, I want to be a scientist and study dolphins and live on a deserted island in the middle of the ocean all by myself. And maybe you and your parrot can visit me there sometimes and bring me food and scientific supplies. And Vlad said that he liked it. And he asked me to type it up and send it over to him because he wanted to make sure that he got it right. And I typed it up and I sent it over. And he sent it back to me. And yes, he got it right. And I don't know how long an average Pantpel relationship lasts. But I felt that hours had run its course. And this is how it ended. But sometimes when Vlad calls, he asks me how his Pantpel is doing and does he still want to be a sea captain. And I tell him that yes, his Pantpel still wants to be a sea captain very much. Because if he didn't, then what does he want to be? Thank you."
36,sloth.wav, So I'm sitting in my shrinks office this one time and he says to me how's it going and I say well to be honest doc I had a really really horrible experience the other day and he says tell me about it and I say well it all started when I was I was laying on my couch and he looks at me and he says really which if you know me as an incredibly funny thing for him to say because I have probably spent more time lying on couches than any able-bodied man under the age of say 110 living today if lying on couches was a martial art I would have a ninth-level black belt ninja master status in it is a matter of fact when I was originally asked by the moth to do this event and they explained about the seven deadly sins I was amazed that swath was even still available I assumed that swath would be the first sin picked because it is really the central thing about our culture isn't it which is all we have we live in a whole society based on consumer entertainment and sort of luxury effort reduction but within that culture my own generation which they used to call Gen X or slackers really distinguished it's distinguished itself even among you know the general culture and within that elite group of of underachievers I distinguished myself is really a super achiever of underachievement if sloth is a sin I am I think it's fair to say I am I'm really guilty of like molosevitch level crimes against humanity and and if if the if the Vatican conducted its affairs the way that governments do there there would be some sort of secret Vatican sniper up in these windows ready to take me out right now I live for years and years and years and just bumming around this wonderful college town called Madison Wisconsin and people know Madison great that's fantastic and we had a whole culture there that was essentially built around couches everything was centered around the living room because what your life consisted of was every second that you weren't slaving away at your shitty minimum wage job and that's I'd like to dispel a myth about slackers right now which is that they don't work hard because in order to live a life of sloth you really have to work like a slave to do it because opting out of the career rat race essentially means opting into the working poor you know and and and and so every second that you weren't at that job you were sitting in your living room sitting with your friends you're watching TV you're smoking pot you're listening to rock and roll and watching DVDs and but but but mainly just engaging in conversation and you're trying to ring every last ounce of leisure of luxury effort reduction out of the remaining hours before your shift at the job you hate starts again we had a wonderful tradition in Madison because every year this when the students would move the frat guys would leave their furniture bow band and by the side of the road and so every year you would take the cigarette hole burned beer stained vomit smelling couch that just stink like weed and cigarettes and you would pick it up and you'd march it out of the house and you'd set it down and then you'd go get a brand new couch from the frat kids and you'd move it into the empty space where you have the previous couch and you'd set it down and you'd have a wonderful new couch to abuse for the following year now one of the things I did during all these years of slacking in Madison was I was writing jokes for the onion and to my great surprise that eventually turned into a career and and no one could have been more surprised about it than me believe me and I ended up moving to New York and for the first time I had money so I was incredibly excited because I was not only going to be able to live this life of slack but I was going to be able to live it in style and I set up this one I got this wonderful apartment in Brooklyn this nice living room and I filled it with with seating I bought a I bought a surround sound home theater and I got a DVD player for it I got a big TV and and and I got a fantastic number for a great connection with it just top-notch weed delivery service and and the best thing is I bought this fantastic it was the couch of my dreams at this vintage store I spent five hundred dollars on it only couch I ever spent money on in my life and and I was so looking forward to all the wonderful times I was gonna have with all these great new friends I was gonna make in New York but what I didn't understand was that New York is not like Madison it's not a living room based town because all of the you know lower east side you know downtown Bohemians that I was wanting to hang out with they don't have living rooms they they have a box with a bed and a refrigerator and a toilet and a shower and a sink and that's what there's where they live and so in the lieu of the hangout living rooms they hang out in bars and restaurants now and and for that reason it's also not a marijuana town it's an alcohol town so I've had to learn to drink and I'm I'm getting pretty good at it to be honest but but you know none of those things really matter if like me you live in Brooklyn but people from Manhattan won't go to Brooklyn because it's a 20-minute ride on the train and they're busy spending 40 to 80 minutes waiting to get into the cool restaurant or bar so the upshot of all this is I spend about the next five years of my life in the ultimate slack pad I've created surrounded by empty seats alone playing video games watching DVDs by myself surrounded by empty seating and what's worse is that is that my my DVD player even mocks me because whenever he hits stop a screen saver comes on with their consumer entertainment you know home theater slogan that says everyone's invited everyone's invited every day everyone's invited but you're here by yourself aren't you over the years the combined effects of a gravity be time and see my ass on this couch literally destroy my dream couch the part of the couch where my ass is centered has collapsed completely there's like there's like springs and metal falling out the bottom stuffing is falling out the bottom I have to it's to it's just a hole where my ass is I have to I have to fill it up with pillows and and blankets and put a board over it just continue to lay on it now at this point in this story I'm sure that those of you in the audience with even a remote sense of insight into the human condition are probably thinking to yourself well you know these stories are all kind of cute anecdotes and they're a little bit funny but I have another interpretation of everything this man on stage is saying and it sounds kind of to me like he's describing the behavior of someone who is not to put too fine a point on it clinically depressed and you would be right I happen to have been clinically depressed pretty much my entire adult life which brings us back to why I was sitting in my shrinks office in the first place telling him about this horrible experience so he says tell me about it I say I'm laying on the couch and it was one of those days when you've run out of all the distractions available in the living room like I had watched all the DVDs I had finished all the video games I had masturbated to all of the available pornography I smoked all the drugs there was nothing left and I had a moment of zen stillness in clarity where I was face to face with myself and I looked in myself and I saw this horrific nightmarish void of nothingness it was just this swirling vortex of empty zero there was nothing there I felt like I had no future no past no options no hope like there was nothing to believe in and at this point my shrink cuts me off and he says Todd Todd wait wait hold on right now I'm hearing a lot of negativity from you I mean you're just describing a horrible descent into nihilism and I've given this look like well duh you know and I say yeah your reason you're hearing that is because that's what I'm telling you and he says well Todd but that's very serious nihilism is a terrible place to end up bad things happen to people that go there you can drown in that shit so I say well let me tell you do I hear cell phone is that what that is so I tell him maybe some just give me a little hip-hop background to this so I tell him well let me finish the story have you ever been so depressed that you just can't get out of bed or you just can't get out of your chair and you just end up relying on whatever's in arms reach of you you know and so I'm sort of groping around the couch just for just looking for something anything to distract me from this horrible emptiness that I'm experiencing and I reach under the couch and I find this old paper back book that has been kicked under there a couple months earlier and I pull it out and it's the ultimate perfect book for lifting someone out of their own personal hell happens to be swear to God this is true not making this up Dante's in Ferno so so I'm like I obviously cannot handle reading Dante's in Ferno right now but lacking anything else to do I decide I'm going to read the four words so the forward is written by some scholar of medieval Italian epic poetry or whatever and I start reading it and I say to my doc as reading it I learned a new word he says what was it and I said well the word is a cedia I'd never heard of this word before he says what is it me I said well it was the medieval Catholics word for the profound sense of emptiness that comes from not believing in anything they saw it as a sin and specifically the sin of the failure they defined it as the failure to pursue God in other words a lack of making the effort necessary to seek out the joy of God or more generally of creation and it was considered so dangerous that they actually numbered it among the seven deadly sins a cedia and I by the way I don't know if it's actually pronounced a cedia because I'm a college dropout I don't know how to pronounce ancient Latin granted I knew I was going to be speaking in Ferno a couple hundred people I probably could have googled it and figured out the pronunciation but I was too lazy so and at this point I can tell you know I can tell that that my shrink is is is a little uncomfortable with how the conversation's going because he doesn't like talking about sin he doesn't like sin doctrine based modes of behavioral modification because he's a shrink and shrinks are always against thinking about things in terms of sin because sin is always about guilt and a shrink job is to get people to get over guilt so he's kind of trying to change the subject but what I say to him is the amazing thing about this is that in modern times it's usually translated or mistranslated if you will as sloth because it involves a lack of effort but the idea is you know when we hear sloth now I mean it just seems like laziness it's not that big of a sin it's not deadly but they but they were talking about something far more serious they were talking about a deep existential despair thanks and and I realized as I was talking to him that if I'm guilty of a cedia then so is our whole consumer entertainment pro-zac taken depressed out of their mind nation and I figured there's two ways of looking at it either we should be very grateful that ancient Catholic doctrine doesn't still dominate the intellectual world because if so then me and the whole nation are all just guilty unredeemable sinners and can be written off but the second way of looking at it there's perhaps a little more productive is that this was a way of looking at my depression that didn't involve me being a helpless victim of a sickness defined by a condition and that I might have some degree of personal responsibility for my own state of mind so my shrink looks at me and he doesn't say anything for a very long time because he doesn't like how the conversation's going but on the other end he's a smart guy so he's thinking very very intently and finally he looks up at me and he says that's very interesting what are you going to do about it and I look back at him and I say hmm thank you
37,wildwomenanddancingqueens.wav," When I was younger, the word beautiful was just an extension of the word pretty. I remember when I was seven, my birthday wish was to have blonde hair, blue eyes, and a change my name to Christina. And I don't know why that would have made me feel good about myself, but I just, I guess I wanted to change who I was because appearance was something I was never very comfortable with. One day in 2014, it was the summer right before my freshman year of high school. We'd be here for me. And my mom, she signs me up for this farm in wilderness camp. It's called Indian Brook. And the only thing I knew about it was that it was fun because that's when my mom promised me it would be. So, you know, it's how moms are. But it's this all girls camp. So it's, you know, like pro women, it's like super cool. And I'm really excited. So I'm in the van going to camp and I'm sitting in the back with a bunch of other girls. And I really want to start like making friends and finding my place. So I do what I've always done to make friends. I start complimenting everybody and I turn to the girl next to me. Like, you know, you're shirt. Oh my God, like your shirt is really cute. And she's like, thanks, but nobody talk. And I'm like, oh, right. What's that? And she tells me that it's just like policy at camp where when you compliment people, you don't talk about their appearance, what they look like, anything in that aspect. You only compliment them on their abilities and the cool stuff they can do. And that's something that's always really stuck with me. It's something I've always really loved. And it's always just kind of faded away from me in the society that I live in. I kind of become detached from it in whatever this is. One night, like maybe in the middle of camp. I hear all my friends talking about staff night. And I, again, don't know what that is. And my friend tells me that it's like this tradition for senior lodge on staff night, basically all of our counselors go up to the lodge and they have like this PTA type meeting about camp and like what's working, what's not. And they make all of these like executive decisions and changes. They leave all of us at camp alone in our cabins. Yeah. So basically they go up to the lodge, were alone, and the village should like people from nearby. They just like, they walk around and they make sure we're good, you know, nobody's dead. No cabins are on fire, nothing like that, no contraband. But my friends are telling me about the tradition that senior lodge does. And I'm like, yeah, I can do that. That sounds fun. And I hear the rest of my bunk mates start talking more about it. They're like, yeah, are we going to do that thing? Yeah, because we didn't do that last year. We should totally do that. And I'm like, hey, I turn to my friend, what are we doing? She says, we're going to do that. Okay, I turn to my friend, what are we doing? She says, we're going streaking. Now mind you, I'm a 14 year old girl. I'm already awkward enough as it is with clothes on. Now I don't know what to think. And I go through my entire day at camp just, I'm freaking out about this because I like, what can I do? I don't know how to feel. I'm just, I'm scared. I'm just terrified. And it's all I can think about when I'm eating, like dining hall, Barnes and Gardens, like workshop, this only thing that's on my mind. I'm like, holy crap, man, like I'm going to be naked later. And when it finally comes time to do the thing, all my friends are just like counting down, like on somebody's watch, like the hour when we're going to go out. And I'm just kind of, I'm still terrified, freaking out. And when it gets to maybe around like eight-ish, all of my bunk mates jump out of their beds, rip off their clothes off, start screaming. They're like, yeah, for nipple men, it's just like, it's crazy. It is total chaos. And I'm standing there in my bra and underwear, I'm just like, oh my god. This is, oh, this is, this is nuts. And I want to be a part of this. I want to do this thing. And I know that it's a very unconventional thing that I'm probably never going to get the chance to do again. So at the end of the day, I'm just like, you know what, guys? Fuck it. And I rip off my, my clothes too. I'm out here. You know, it's crazy. I'm, I'm, I'm naked with my shoes on. Like, who does that? It's wild. And we all run outside into the woods and we're, we're making our way around camp. We're running in circles like crazy people screaming at the top of our lungs. We're weak and everybody up is wild. And we finally, we were like making our way up to the lodge and like, it's dark and it had just rained and it's wet and, and I'm freaking out about all these things. Like, what if I get a tick? What if I get like mosquito bites? What if I fall down? But the only thing, the, the one thing I'm not worrying about at all is what I look like. And we finally make our way up to the lodge. I don't know who started it. Somebody starts singing Dancing Queen. We all join in. Our counselors are cracking up at us through the windows because we're crazy. Wild man, wild women to the woods tonight. And we're just, we're jumping around. We're going crazy. We're singing together and we, at the end of it all, we just kind of like regroup. We go back to our cabins. We go to sleep and it's kind of the end of it. And I mean, that's not to say that I am 100% body confident after this like spiritual experience because you know, like bodies are just like weird and like puberty is what in teens are just like, whoa, you know, like it's just a lot of, it's just a lot of confusion in that department. It's very strange. A lot of weird changes going on. On that night, to me, I was a Dancing Queen. I was a wild woman of the woods. I was a hardcore lady type and beautiful was just a bunch of crazy screaming naked girls running around with mud on their legs being brave together."
38,thefreedomridersandme.wav," My brother and I were born and raised in Jackson, Mississippi during Jim Crow. In 1961, my brother got involved with Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement. He became a freedom rider. Well, I loved my brother and I always wanted to do everything he did, but I did not know what a freedom rider was. But my brother was 19 and I was only 13. So this actually became a very serious movement for him because the freedom riders were challenging segregation in interstate transportation across the South. And so they were the colored only white only signs and the separation and bathrooms and restaurants and water fountains and all of that. And so my, this was very dangerous for them as well because the Ku Klux Klan did not want this to happen. So they were getting beat up and arrested and all of that. Well my young friends and I heard about the protest and the sit-ins. So we thought, oh, okay, we can do this and could have fun doing it because there were, it wasn't that we didn't understand what was going on. But we would be able to go into restaurants and shops that said white only. So for instance, there was a restaurant in our neighborhood that we used to go to almost every day after school. But on one side it said colored only, on the other side it said white only. So the color side was kind of small. It had a couple of booths, a jukebox. We could put a nickel in there and here a music and a counter. And if we wanted to get something to eat, there was a window there with a doorbell. So we'd go up to that window. We could order hot dogs, French fries and sodas on paper plates and cups. But as you stand in there at that window, you could see the other side. And the other side was big with lots of tables, white tablecloths and settings and white people were seated and being served dinner. So this was wrong. This was how we were treated. And we understood that. So because when my mother would take us shopping for a school clothes, the first thing she'd say to me is, Bob, go use the bathroom. And I'm like, Mama, I already used to go use the bathroom again. And I didn't understand that. So until we were downtown one day in the store and she had picked out a few items and I had to use the bathroom. And she got very upset with me. She had to put those things back. We had to leave that store and go to a feeder street where there were colored businesses. Use the bathroom, go back to the store and start over again. And while we were in the store, she had to know my sizes because they would not allow us to try on clothes or shoes. If you bought something that was too small or too big, they would not allow us to bring it back. So when we would leave the store, Mama would grab my hand. And I said, Mama, I'm a big girl. You don't have to shut up, gal. And when a white person would approach us, we had to get off the sidewalk and let them buy. Well, Mama had to pull me off the sidewalk. And so I did understand what was going on, how we would be treated and that it was wrong. I just didn't understand what the civil rights movement or what the freedom writers could do about it because this was our lives. This was how we were raised. This was how it was. This was what we accepted. And I didn't know, I didn't think that there was anything that could be done about it. Until several years later, one day I was coming home from downtown with my friends. And I was going up my street, my house was on the corner. So as I was walking up, everybody was saying, Bobby, Bobby, you need to get home. The mom got sick and she was taken to the hospital. And so first of all, I'm like hospital. We never went to the hospital. Mama always had home remedies. So I ran home and I tried to find someone to take me and I couldn't. So I ran up to the hospital. And when I got there, Mama was sitting in the waiting room, the emergency room with the friend who had brought her there. And she was very distraught. She looked like she was going to pass out. And she was sweaty, clammy. And she had a cold paper towel on her head. And she said, I'm trying to keep from vomiting again. And her friend told me, you know, she had vomiting at a washpan full of blood. And I'm like, I didn't believe that. This is a washpan. And so I said, well, how long have you guys been here? And he said, we've been here since about two o'clock. And I looked and it was about 5'30. So I went up to the desk and I said, you know, my mama's been here since two. She needs to see the doctor. She needs to lie down. And the young lady said, very rudely, we don't have a bed for your mother. And there are other people here who need to see the doctor before your mother. So all I could do was go and sit down and wait with them. And as I'm sitting there, I'm seeing people being called up to see the doctor. Now some of them might have been there before me. But most of them were coming in after and they were being called. They were all white. So about 9'30 or so, they call mama. And I said, wow, I was glad. I said she can lie down. She'll see the doctor taking in the treatment room. So we're waiting for the doctor. And the nurse came in with the wheelchair. And she said, I'm sorry. We're going to have to put your mother outside the door for a while because we have someone else who needs to see the doctor. And I was like, no, my mama's been here since two o'clock. She needs to see the doctor. Well, I'm a teenager so they ignored me. So when they went together, she vomited. And she almost filled that room with blood. So now nurses and doctors are coming from everywhere. And she needs blood transfusions and all of that. And they took her up to the fifth floor. So my brother came and we went up to the fifth floor. And she came from mama. And as I was passing by this treatment room, I heard a burst of laughter coming out. And I looked through the little crack and doctors and nurses. And I said, that's where mama is. Because no matter what was going on or whether she was sick or whatever, mama always had something funny to say or do, to make your laugh. And so they took her to 501. And we're waiting outside the room to go in to see her. I wanted to hug mama. I wanted to say I love you. The doctor came out and he said, it's very late. We're trying to get her admitted. Why don't y'all go home and come back the next day? I don't want to leave. I want to see mama. I want to say I love you because we were a family who never said that to one another. I never remembered saying that to my mama. But he wouldn't let us in. So we left. And the very next morning we came back, she was critical. So we were waiting outside her room again and waiting to go in and see her. And to say I love you. And the doctor came out and he said, we're preparing your mother for surgery. And so we couldn't go in again. And so when they were rolling her out on the stretcher, I could see just the glimpse of her face between their bodies. And her eyes were swollen and red and she had tears. And I just got this big hard ball right in the middle of my chest. And we went down to the second floor waiting for her to come out of surgery. And we waited and waited and waited. And finally the doctor came out and he said, I'm sorry, your mother didn't make it. And I just burst into tears and I cried and I cried and I cried for days. But it was at that moment that I realized what that civil rights movement was all about. I realized why those freedom writers were challenging the colored only, white only signs and going to restaurants. And I even realized why we went in to do sit-ins and protest. This movement was about our lives. This movement was about equality. This movement was about our life and death."
39,mayorofthefreaks.wav," In San Antonio, Texas, in 1991, I was a goth kid. I had a very specific group of friends. We wore a lot of dog collars, his fashion accessories. There was a lot of torn fishnet and misty black eyes. We changed our names to things like Raven and Salem and Epiphany. We made facial piercings out of office supplies. And we wrote poetry that was really way too dark for any of you to understand. And I love this group of people so much because I spent most of middle school as a sort of a closeted outsider. And when I met these kids, I finally felt like I found my crew. Being gay was the least interesting thing about me. They were like, that's all you got. And we were so happy being so sad together. And then a few years in high school, my mom told me that she was getting remarried. And we were moving to a very small town called Sigin, Texas. Now, you might think of Texas as all the same, like Dallas, the TV show. But San Antonio is a quite large city. I think it's like the eighth largest city in America. But Sigin was super tiny. There was nowhere to buy clothes, cigarettes. I was so pissed. I started high school in Sigin and I felt more like an outsider than I ever had before. I would wander the halls with my black fingernails and my rubber band bracelets. And I was surrounded by girls with spiral perms and Daisy Duke shorts. And guys who were flannel and love Pearl Jam, I felt like Jane Goodall. I was sort of creeping through the jungle, hoping they don't realize I'm not a monkey. A few months after going to school in Sigin, I got... I heard that there was going to be this sort of party in New Braunfels. It was going to be like a freak party, like a bunch of misfits and weirdos. And I was so excited. New Braunfels was a little town about 20 minutes away, so I got all done up in my alt-team gothery. I put on my favorite Suzy in the band-chise shirt, which was torn in just the right places. I put a light powder on my face, which I always did, but I never blended it at the jaw. So when you look at photos of me, I look like an albino that just got a sunburnt neck, somehow. And then I geled my hair back into this little vampire-listat ponytail. And it was so tight that when the gel dried, it kind of raised my eyebrows in a look of surprise. I drove to New Braunfels and the party was in a trailer park. I went into the trailer and it was very dark and very loud. And I couldn't make out much at first. It was clear that these people were freaks, but these freaks were not my kind of thing. These freaks were mostly male. They seemed super aggressive, and they were almost all bald. I had inadvertently come to a skin-head party. I suddenly felt like the gayest person that was ever born. Like in a psychological movie that experience in my head, I was dressed like a Las Vegas showgirl. And I was boating, you know. I saw this door on the side of the trailer and I ran out to the hotel. I was like, I'm a trailer and I ran out to this deck on the side of it. And there was one of those blue buzzing bug zapper lights. And I tried to de-gay myself as quickly as possible. I wiped off the makeup. I shook out my little ponytail, but then I just kind of had a weird volumous bob. It was worse, you know. And then I thought, I know I'll smoke, because smoking is really tough. Smoking is butch. I'll have one of my Benson and Hedges menthol light 120's. So I take these sweatlogged matches out of my pocket and I'm trying over and over again to light this match. When this flaming zippo gracefully rises from the darkness and it lights my cigarette. And I look up and towering above me is the largest human being I had seen up to that point in my life. He was a massive skinhead with little suspenders and he's oxblood doc Martin Boots. He introduced himself. He told me his name was Max and I said hi. I'm David and we made some very awkward small talk for about two minutes. And then there was a low. And he looked at me and he said, hey, is anybody ever told you that you look like someone? And I said, probably the lead singer of Depeche mode. I get that all the time. And he said, no, dude, I think you look like that girl that sings in that band D light. And I thought, oh, this is when it happens. This is when I get pushed to the ground and kicked to death with those Doc Martin Boots. But I started laughing. I'm not sure if it was my nerves or the cough syrup that I recreationally drank to get high on the weight of the party. But I thought this was the funniest thing that I'd ever heard in my life. And I started aggressively capping like a hyena. I couldn't stop. And I looked up and all of a sudden this huge skinhead he's laughing to. And he has these little happy Buddha eyes and these dimples and these chubby cheeks. I just want to pinch. He's like a big overgrown toddler skinhead. And we stand out there on that deck and talk for hours. And when we do every single person from this party comes out to greet Max. All sorts of people. Skinheads, guys with Mohawks, these two patchouli stinking girls and these 10,000 maniacs t-shirts. It's like they all know him. Like he's the mayor of freaks in this little town. At one point I mentioned something to him. I'm like, oh, you know, the skinhead over there. And he's like, dude, dude, we're not skinheads. We're not bigots. We're sharps. Skinheads against racial prejudice. I had not heard of that ever. And then he proceeds to like break down their manifesto, which he gets very excited about. He explains to me that what they want to do is take the aesthetic of the enemy and subvert it. He tells me that where skinheads wear white laces for white power, sharps were a multi-colored laces for unity. He tells me that while skinheads are straight edge, they don't smoke weed, take drugs, drink whatever, they do it all, that he huffed a bunch of Scotch guard half an hour ago. Max and I became super fast friends. And in a few months, summer came and it was so exciting because as opposed to waiting for the weekends to hang out, I could basically hang out all the time into Bronfels. And then I was just so happy that I had a friend at all. She was like, go be with your friend. And it was really fun because we were both only sons. And I think we sort of felt like brothers. His house was my summer house. His mom was my summer mom. He was kind of like my summer brother. But there was a weird thing about hanging out with Max. And I wasn't used to being around his friends. They were super machismo. We would go to these parties. And the same thing kept happening. And I was like, why are you here? And just when I was going to die, he would reappear with my beer, towering over everyone and ask, is there a problem here? I felt like Whitney Houston in the bodyguard. I was really, really great. We really enjoyed each other's company and we loved talking to each other. And we would go to these parties and we wouldn't even really interface with his friends. We would just find some little nook or a corner or go in the backyard and we would talk. We would smoke a joint and have these long existential conversations. We talk about it. Most people saw it. Music was cool. The government was ruining everything. And it was cool because it didn't matter what was happening nearby. In the living room there could have been a bunch of sharps, powerlifting cinder blocks while screaming, but it didn't matter because when I talked to Max he looked at me like what I was saying was the most important thing he'd ever heard in his life. And no one had ever made me feel like that before. And when Max talked to me, it was the same. It was kind of like everything else just sort of turned down and faded away. And there was just Max. A few weeks before my senior year was going to start, we were going to this party and we were pre-gaming at his house. We pre-gamed the same way every time he went to a party. I would be in his room in the mirror getting all of my little broaches and things I needed for my look together. And he would be in the kitchen rating the liquor cabinet. He had these two gas station to go koozies and he would make our drinks. Him, Jamison and Coke, and me, a Bacardi and Diet Coke. We got in the car and we started driving to this party. And on the way he told me that we had to make a pit stop. So in a few minutes we pulled off the highway and we drove through this grove of trees and we ended up by this riverbed. And there were these four cars already parked there in a circle with their hazard lights on. And Max told me to wait in the car and he'd be right back. And he joined this huddle of sharps in the middle of all these cars. There were maybe like six or seven of them. And I watched as they started walking very slowly in a circle. And then they started marching in a circle, kind of like angry roosters kicking up all this dust. And then I looked in the middle of this circle was this like little baby sharp. This kid that was a year or two younger than us. He had red hair and freckles. He was in this oversized bomber jacket. I'd seen him at parties before. And then one of the guys spit on the kid's face. And then they all just started punching the hell out of this kid. And he fell on the ground immediately. And when he fell they kept punching and screaming and kicking. And as I'm watching this through the windshield, I'm looking for Max thinking like where did he go? Did he go to pee or something? Like can he come back and stop all of this? But then I see Max's face. And his eyes are bulging out of his skull and his teeth are stripped and spit is flying out of his mouth. And he is kicking and punching this kid just as hard as any of those other guys. And as I watched this, I do realize what it is. I know that it's a beaten. It's this sort of ritual to welcome a new sharp. But that doesn't make it any less terrifying as the kid screams. And even when I rolled the window, I can still hear the kid just screaming and screaming and screaming. Finally they stop. And the kid stands up. And when he stands up, he has this swollen eye. His bottom lip is split in the middle. And there's this crimson ribbon just going down his chin and his neck and his chest. And then Max takes a step forward and he shakes the kid's hand. And then another sharp shakes the kid's hand. And then they start hugging him and patting his back and you know rubbing his head. And it's this big machismo loving all of a sudden. One of the guys looks and he notices me for the first time sitting in the car. And he points and he says, Max, why did you bring him here? Why did you bring this faggot here? And all the sharps turn and look at me and they take a few steps forward. And even the little one that just got beat up, he's looking at me with this glimmer in his eyes. And it occurs to me that what they're about to do to me is an ritual. They won't necessarily stop and they definitely won't hug me after. One of the guys goes to open the door and Max stops him and he says, David's off limits. And everyone sort of freezes for a moment like the hierarchy is very confusing. No one knows what to do and Max reaches in his pocket and he takes out the car keys and he gets in the driver's seat and we drive away. In the car on the way home, I don't know what to say to Max. Which really is upsetting to me because the reason I love Max and the reason he's my summer brother is because I always know what to say to Max. He's my best friend and I don't think Max knows what to say either because he just turns up the stereo as loud as he can and he grips the steering wheel and he looks at the road. We got home that night and we went to bed and early the next morning I woke up before anyone was up and I left without saying goodbye. And the next day we didn't talk and the next week we didn't talk and we didn't call each other again. It was like we just disagreed without words. It was like we both knew that what had happened had changed something in our friendship. That senior year of high school in Seguin, I actually did really well which was shocking. I had been doing really bad in high school because of all the acid previously and not going to high school. But I pulled it together my senior year. I made no grade less than a C. My mother was so excited she threw me a no grade less than a C party for David. At the end of my senior year I get an envelope in the mail and it tells me that I've been accepted into college which is crazy to me. I'm like there's something wrong with their automated system. What college would have me, you know? But I'm really excited to go to college. It's in this little town San Marcos about 30 minutes away. A few days before I'm going to start I go to this house party in that town. And when I open the door the first person I see in here from the back of the room is Max and he screams dude! And he comes at me like a linebacker and I can tell everyone at the party is terrified. They're like what is this giant going to do to this tiny boy? But what Max does is he wraps his arms around me and he hugs me so hard that I have to say please dude you're crushing my ribcage. We sit down on the couch and we start talking and it's like no time to pass. It's just so good to see him. We're catching each other up about our friends and our families and we realize in our conversation that Max has also been accepted to the same colleges me and San Marcos and this is mind blowing to me the idea that now we're both adults. And we're going to experience this new part of our life together in this new town away from our crappy little towns. And at the end of the night we hug goodbye and no one has to apologize or talk about the past. It's just like that horrible night kind of evaporates. A few days after that Max was driving down this highway at Loop 1604 outside of San Antonio and he lost control of his car and he flipped it and he ended up upside down in the emergency lane. And he was suspended by his seatbelt. And when he came to he started to barge his way out of the door and when he finally did he fell right in front of an oncoming truck and he was killed instantly. A few days later I went to his funeral in New Bronfels and I hadn't been back to New Bronfels since that night of the beaten and I looked around there were hundreds and hundreds of his friends there because he was the mayor freaks. And I wanted to talk to them but it seemed as strange to talk to them without Max there as it had been when he was alive. And I got in this line of all these people waiting to greet his family and I could see up ahead that I was getting close to his mom my summer mom and I was telling myself I'm going to say such profound awesome things to her. I'm going to make sure she knows how cool her son was and how important it was to him that people felt like they belonged and how he made me feel like I had a friend. But instead when I get there the minute I look into her eyes I just collapse into her arms and I whisper in her ear your hair smells so pretty. That was 20 years ago and for the last 20 years every time I go back to San Antonio I will drive to New Bronfels and I'll go to the cemetery where Max is and I will go and I will sit and I will talk to him. I talk to him about the same stuff I always did I talk to him about how most people still suck but music still pretty cool and the government is still ruining everything. And I'm not a particularly devout or religious person but every time I'm sitting there talking to him there will be this moment and sometimes it's imperceptible where the construction on the other side of the fence or the highway right by the cemetery it sort of disappears and in just that moment there's just me and there's just Max. Thank you."
40,vixenandtheussr.wav," Well, we all have a lot of good laughs back when Sarah Palin was running for Vice President with this. But I'm here to tell you truth that there are people in Alaska that can see Russia from their house. You see the Alaska mainland and the Russian mainland are less than 60 miles apart. This is what forms the Bearing Street. And right in the middle of the Bearing Street are two small islands, just two and a half miles apart. And the border between our two countries runs right down between those two islands. And that means that the people who live on little dime-eat, whenever they look out their window, they can't help but see Russia. Now also the international date line runs between those two islands. And the dime-eaters kind of get a kick out of saying, well, we live in today, but we're looking at tomorrow. But the Russians get an even bigger kick out of saying, we live in today and look at yesterday. Well, I'm old enough that I was born or grew up during the height of the Cold War in what was called the Duck and Cover Years. Because as elementary kids, we went through regular drills where we had to duck under our desks and cover our heads in case the Soviet Union dropped an atomic bomb on us. So I grew up very fearful of the Soviet Union. It seemed like a very dark, very grim, and very distant place. So in 1985, when I landed on little dime-eat as a wildlife biologist to work on a wallar study with the local people, I found myself face-to-face with what I had grown up, and what I was thinking about was the evil empire. Fortunately, there was a warming, a political warming between our countries in the late 1980s. And this led to an opening and an opportunity to visit. Well, this ice curtain that ran between these two islands and divided our barring straight began to thaw. And the first people to take advantage of this were adventurers who wanted to cross the barring street. And because of my connection with the little dime-eaters, it actually led to an invitation to bring my dog team over to the USSR. Now my most favorite thing in life had been seeing Alaska from the back of a dog sled pulled by my nine best friends. These dogs were my family. And because I loved to travel in camp, I was partial to really big, tall, legged, happy dogs. But I had one dog in there that was a misfit. And this was a small, tiny, little white husky with ice blue eyes named Vickson. And I had taken her simply because a friend was desperate to find a home for her. Well, she remained shy with other people, but she formed a bond with me. And very soon she was a steadfast member of our team. So in April of 1990, myself and another American are in Noma, Alaska. And we are loading up all our dogs, our dogs' sleds, our gear into a small, barring airplane. We take off from Noma, Alaska, and an hour and twenty minutes later, we land a world away in Providenia, USSR. We mushed our dogs right out of the airport and out onto the ice, where there was a big bonfire and a picnic. And these people who I had grown up thinking of as my enemy were welcoming us and embracing us with an outpouring of friendship and goodwill and vodka. We started our journey the very next day. There was us two Americans. There were four non-data Russians and two Russian chukchi muskers. And we were to embark on a two-week, two-hundred-mile northbound journey up the coast of the USSR. It's beautiful country. It's completely treeless country. And we traversed mountains, rolling tundra, sea ice, and visited these far-flung native villages all along the coast. And everywhere we went, we were greeted with tremendous friendship and generosity and women with basins of seal meat and walrus meat for our dogs. One particularly memorable day, we crested a hill and it just disoriented me a moment because I found myself staring at the Diamond Islands from the opposite side. It was like looking in a mirror. And for the first time, this divided barring straight became whole. Two weeks passed far too quickly and we found ourselves at our final destination, the village of Uelon, where we were met both by traditional native dances as well as two Soviet biplanes parked on the ice of the lagoon behind the village. They were there to carry our dog teams back to Provodena where we'd begun this trip. So we loaded our sleds and our dogs and our gear into these plains. I sat on my sled and I clipped my dogs in all around me. We taxied down the lagoon, lifted into the air. I could look out this small window and I could see the villagers down below waving at us. And then all of a sudden the plane erupted with panicked commands in Russian that I of course didn't understand. But I laid down on my sled and I braced myself. We were about a hundred feet up and the plane stalled and it just fell and crashed almost belly flopped down on the ice. The next thing I remember was waking up to the sounds of frantic dogs barking and the smell of fuel. I was injured but I was able to go around and unclip each one of my dogs loose. The very last dog was Vixen and she was on her side thrashing about with fuel spilling down on her from the wing. And as I carried her and pitched her out of the plane I stepped over the body of one of my dogs that I knew now had died. Well once out on the ice we all regrouped. I learned that two more dogs had died and then far more tragically one of our Russian teammates had been killed as well. The griefs stricken villagers took myself and the other wounded Russian on sleds and they carried us back to their village and they put us in their clinic for the night. And early the next morning one of my teammates came and they said we've been rounding up all the dogs and we found all of them except Vixen. And then they said there is also a Russian military helicopter on its way. They want to get you and your dogs, the wounded American out of the Soviet Union as fast as possible. I beg them please let me stay, let me look for my dog, she's very shy, she's not going to come to anyone but me but they wouldn't allow it. And as they were loading me onto the helicopter I think in a desire to make up for my losses one of the women from the village put a little brown puppy in my lap. So very quickly we were back in Providenia and even quicker back in Noam Alaska. I had four broken ribs and some pretty serious bruising. But I was able to take comfort I could call an English speaking woman in the village of ULN and she would try to find my dog and she would tell me how she and her daughter were walking the hills and calling for Vixen and that hunters were putting meat by the plane in an effort to draw her in. But no one had seen her. But she did offer me some comfort when she said that my former teammates had dug a shallow grave and buried all three dogs that had died together and that they had made sure that my dogs had was pointed east towards his home in Alaska. So six weeks passed and still no word of Vixen. And one day I get a call from Bering Air that a letter has come over from me from Providenia. I run down, I rip it open, my God my friend writes he has found Vixen. Apparently all this time while everyone was looking for her up north she was retracing our practice journey all the way back to Providenia and she had been found amongst the other stray dogs in Providenia and she was still wearing her American style harness almost two months after the crash. My friend wrote Vixen is still shy and when I went to grab her she ducked into a tunnel and he said I had to crawl 50 meters in the darkness, the dirtness and the dustness until he had her cornered and he said and then we had a 30 minute conversation. In English, before he felt he could grab her. So I immediately run home, I call my friend and I say oh my God she must be sick, she must be thin, she must be starved after this journey. And he said Susanna, my wife Luba is a very good cook. Okay so some days go by, the next Bering Air flight returns from Providenia. I go down to claim my dog and there's no Vixen. I run back to home, I call Oleg, Oleg what's the problem? And he says Susanna it's something about that disease that makes dogs crazy. And I was like okay Rabies of course. Well she's got all of her vaccinations and I gather up her vaccinations in her tags and I send them back over on Bering Air and I wait for the return flight and again no Vixen. We go through this one time there's been a quarantine, another time there's another problem and finally it's like Oleg please. And he said Susanna the authorities that are just not very interested in your dog. Well this was an extraordinary time in the reconnection between the United States and the Soviet Union. And for about three years the Soviets really cared about how they were being viewed in the American press. So I took a chance and I told my friend a very big lie. I said Oleg do your authorities understand that there are newspaper reporters here and radio station people and television reporters they're all here waiting for this dog to come home. Oh Susanna you should have told me this sooner. Vixen was home on the next flight. And she was looking good. I was expecting a skinny dog and that's not what I got. And as soon as I had her home I called my friend again and I felt like I needed to fess up that I lied. And he said oh Susanna you understand the Russian system very good. So I felt like I told a lie to get Vixen home. So what I decided I would call the Anchorage Daily News and I'd give them the story. They seemed interested. They wrote it up. They put it out on the Associated Press and lo and behold that story got picked up by newspapers all across the country even around the world and eventually she made it into Ripley's believe it or not. But I had told the story before I realized that the reason Vixen was looking so filled out wasn't just because of Lubas good cooking but my little girl had come home pregnant. Less than two months later she gave birth to seven Russian American puppies. I named every one of them for one of my new dear Russian friends and the local press dubbed them the Gloss nose pups. So this was truly an extraordinary and an exuberant time in the reconnection between our two countries. And just as miraculous as this little dog finding her way all the way back to Providenia 200 miles without a trail was that people who had long lived in fear and distrust of one another had come together out of friendship to bring a little lost dog home."
41,theadvancedbeginner.wav," I grew up thinking that a life partner and a dance partner should be the same person. Thank you, Fred and Ginger. I never had that much trouble finding anybody to marry me until I gave it up myself as something of a youthful folly. Dance partners while not exactly plentiful were not totally absent either. And these days, even now, if I would like to dance, I bring out my most corn-pone magnolia blossom accent. Young man, I'm wondering if I could persuade you to bring some joy to my declining years by dancing with me. Now, I'm going to talk a lot about dancing. I don't want you to think I'm really a good dancer, a great dancer, anything. I mean, I can hear the beat, usually. We can see that I am not possessed of that classic dancers' body that makes us all wonder where they keep their internal organs. I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, and in my generation, gently-reared young ladies were treated to tap and ballet lessons by their parents. Also in that parental package was attendance at the ballet. And in our case in Louisville, Kentucky, once a year, Jose Greco came through with his flamenco company. And even then, you could see a lot of flamenco dancing on the Ed Sullivan show. I completely fell in love with that type of dancing. The castonettes, the fans, the shawls, the loud clacking of the feet and everything. Of course, you couldn't study it back then where I was from. But I felt that somehow or other, this was mine. I just wanted to do that. And so when we had our dance recital, and there was a gypsy-esque dance in that recital, and it was given to another child who got to wear the black and red costume, and probably could tell her right from her left, she was a better dancer, I have to say. But I was just devastated. And the fact that I was 12 years old, and I'm still talking about it, should kind of convince you that I'm serious about this whole flamenco thing. So life happens, you know, 30 or 40 years past, and normal things. You know, I had a wonderful child, I taught school. You know, things just go along, and flamenco was on that distant shore. And every now and then you see a little something on TV or in a movie, and I think, yeah, I remember how I used to feel about wanting to do that. Then, when I was about 65, moving right along, I had a really rough time. I lost a little money, I think a lot of people did around that time. I retired and it felt very sudden to me. I met somebody who just knocked me off my perch, I have to say. And I thought, what is going on? You know, I'm like becoming an old lady, and I have this huge crush on this man who's just who seems to like me too. Oh my God, you know, I had the rest of my life figured out, and this was not in it. But that didn't have to worry, because nothing ever really came of it. It ended before it started. Now, of course, now I'm heartbroken. You know, I'm like, what am I going to do? Oh no, now I, oh dear. And so I was very depressed. And so, you know, that kind of falling is one thing. Then I fell down the stairs too. Messed up my shoulder. I opened the freezer to get a frozen bottle of water out, and it fell on my toe, and I broke my toe. And over the years, you know, I had done a little dancing. But now I was, I just hurt. I showed her hurt, my toe hurt, my heart hurt. I just, you know, I was just really down and really sad. And even though I, in my depression, and my weight gain and all that, you know, I knew exercise was the answer to everything, but I also knew I wasn't going to do it because I just hurt all over, you know, it was really a really difficult time. I felt really old. I felt spent. I just, it was just really difficult time. You know, time passes. And I crawled about it at whole somehow. I bought a fit bit. I was always very reluctant in this area, but I just pushed myself and forced myself. So then I heard about this dance, not too far from my house, at this VFW post, and it turns out I went and I was like the youngest person there. It wasn't really supposed to be a senior citizen dance. It was just supposed to be a dance and they just all got old, you know, the ones who didn't die. And so they had this really big dance floor and, you know, this guy plays, I mean, live music, not a band, but live music. I mean, he's alive. And I didn't really expect anybody to dance with me. And then finally, this one lovely gentleman, he's very nice, he's 89. They're just so cute at that age. He started, you know, asking me to dance and criticizing my hairdo and one night he said, you know, for a woman in your age, you don't really have all that many wrinkles. You know, just sweet. So you know, that sort of motivated me and then you know, you get a little momentum going. And one day I'm sitting in my house and on Facebook and ping, there's something on there from this girl I know. She wasn't directing you that. She just said, well, is there anybody out there who wants to teach the senior citizen fitness class at the Y? We just can't find anybody to teach those people. I messaged her, I said, take that down right now and give me the number. You know, I'm just thinking, why not? I had actually attended that class a few years before and I thought I could probably maybe do that. Plus, it would get my sorry self out of the house two days a week, two classes on those two days. She gave me the number and two days later I was hired. So she said, now, you know, we have quite a bit of training. You have to take CPR and those, that thing I'm supposed to know the name of, you know, the Fibre later thing that's, they're hanging all over the place. I had to learn how to, please, please, I hope everybody's fine. Right now. But anyway, you know, and then I drove up to Columbus, so how I'll take the silver sneakers training and silver sneakers are very strict, you know, you're dealing with a fragile demographic here. And, you know, I have to remind them three times every class, you know, to drink water and I have to say the chairs there if you need it and I have to do all this stuff. So finally, they let me, you know, teach. So, between the people on Sunday night, the dancers on Sunday night and then my classes on Tuesday and Thursday, I mean, I'm supposed to be motivating them, but I mean, these people show up on those, you know, rolling things and all that stuff. And yes, they do die, but not in class, but yet. But they, you know, the thing is, it's not in activity that's taking them down. It's something else because they're dancing up to the end, you know, they're working out up to the end. And I find this, I mean, they're in their 80s and 90s. I find this very inspiring. So one day I was walking past Flamenco Louisville. We do have one of the finest Flamenco schools in that whole area. And I thought to myself, okay, I've got the money. I've got the time. I believe I had the stamina. Look, there's the opportunity. So I just went into Flamenco Louisville and I said, what's the story? They said, well, we have a beginner beginner class. And I thought, don't you dare say it's 8 o'clock in the morning because even my love of Flamenco, I don't know if I could do that. She said, it's 1 o'clock on Saturday. So I showed up at 1 o'clock on Saturday for the beginner beginner class. That was September of 2014. I'm still in the beginner class. You know, you don't get promoted until you learn a whole lot of stuff. And... But, you know, I'm committed. Progress, not perfection. I put that on a shirt. Progress, not perfection. And I never got worse at anything I practiced. I didn't always get better. But I never, I never got worse. So every Saturday and sometimes every now and then I have a private class, paid for by the YMCA salary. And I just go. And when I go to Spain in two months time, I will be going as a tourist. But in my heart, I will also be going as a dancer."
42,food.wav," I was born on this island. I got my first job in a kitchen when I was 13 years old in the same building where my grandparents met. I started out making salads, but quickly switched to washing dishes because the dishwashers were much better fed. My culinary education up to this point was pretty unique. My father taught me how to gather muscles from the bottom of rocks and lure bluefish and set lobster pots at a very young age. He taught me how to skin a deer long before teaching me how to cook the tenderloin. I then went to preschool in a converted chicken coop. My classmates and I would hunt and peck our way around the playground like chickens that preceded us. I graduated onto a two-room schoolhouse in the center of Chilmark. Instead of class pictures, we took school pictures, usually nine or ten of us on the front steps. I like to watch the seasons go by through the windows, and when my dad would drive by with lobster pots piled in the back of his truck I knew that it was spring and that summer would soon be there. It wasn't until I moved to New York City that I realized how unique my childhood had been. I found myself in February on a Saturday night, a very cold Saturday night with my best friend in Greenwich Village at Bobo Restaurant, owned by Mario Batali. It had recently gotten three stars from the New York Times. I had never been, I had never heard of it he'd been before. We slinked through the bar where people were just mobbed and we got to the main dining room and we sat at a banquet. In waiters danced around and vests and white shirts. It's an Italian restaurant and we had pasta, but what I remember most is the steak. It was a rib-eye. I'd never had a rib-eye before. It was rich and juicy, and they finished it with rock salt and aged balsamic vinegar. I drank barolo for the first time and I thought to myself, I really need to know how to cook this food. I don't just want to, there's something inside me that needs to learn how to do this, so I went back to Bobo the next morning and asked them for a job. They must have been desperate because they gave me one. And I started the next day. I showed up for work the first day without any knives. I didn't know you were supposed to bring your own knives. So I borrowed one from the chef. And I was also wearing Nike running pants that were a little bit too tight underneath my apron, so I got a nickname on my first day, Chrissypants. It wasn't very flattering, but I didn't care. I felt so lucky. I was working in a restaurant beyond my wildest dreams. A restaurant I didn't even know existed before, a week before, and I had my first kitchen nickname. The first night on the line was terrifying. I stood behind the line with these other chefs as they got ready for service, and they were duct taping their wounds, they were duct taping their burns. They were drinking copious amounts of coffee out of big, plastic quart containers. They were dunking their headbands and buckets of ice water and wrapping their heads. It was like a scene from Braveheart, and all of these warriors were getting ready for battle, and they knew exactly what to do, and I did not. So I stood there, and I tried not to get anybody's way, and the chef Frank started calling out orders. Two brands, you know, three guinea-hand, I need a squab, skirt medium well, and I just froze. I had no idea what he was saying, and the guy that was supposed to teach me that night started throwing different chunks of meat from different animals on the flame, and it started spitting fire back at him, and then he gently laid two fish on the grill, two whole fish, and it was so beautiful, and then he threw more meat on, and the flame spat back. It was total chaos to me, and I didn't speak the language, and it took me a long time to learn the language, and I worked really hard, and I worked my way through the stations from Sate to Pasta, and the Pasta station felt like you were taking a bath in boiling water the first night, and I became the sous chef after 18 months, and then I burnt out a year later, and I came back home. The day that I want to tell you about was a hot day in August. It was a Tuesday. I woke up on the farm. At this point, I was running my family's farm. I was the chef at a restaurant less than a mile away, and I was trying to write a book. I was doing too much, and I woke up on the farm, and the farm, Groggy, went to the fish market to see what was freshest, and then I went to work. At about 11 a.m., we had our menu meeting for the day with the kitchen team. At this point, our menu was really small. It was focused on the ingredients that we were growing, and the ingredients we could get from other farmers, but it was also influenced by the fact that most of our kitchen equipment was broken, and we were only capable of cooking a few things a night, so we kept it very small. Everything was unraveling. I had a big beard. My truck no longer had reverse, which made parking very difficult, or a group effort. We made our plan for the day, and we began to prep, organize, get ready. By 2 p.m., the menu was pretty much solidified. We all felt good. At 3 p.m., the general manager Dennis came in. He was out of breath. He was almost hyperventilating, and he said, he told me he had just seen a black SUV with tinted windows, a Virginia license plate, come through the driveway and leave. I turned the radio back up, we kept dancing and prepping, and generally happy, and I didn't think very much of it. Half an hour later, he came back, and now he looked like he was going to have a heart attack, and he was sweating through his shirt. And he said, there's 3 SUVs, and they're parked in the parking lot, and they're not leaving. I think tonight's the night. So I checked the reservation book for DC area codes, pseudonyms, any clue we couldn't find any. At 4.30, we sat down for family meal, and we went over the menu for the night, with the wait staff, the kitchen crew, and I looked out the window, and there was a swarm of secret servicemen, inspecting our stone walls and our sheds in the grounds. And I thought, this is probably the night. So I went to the kitchen, people started to trickle in, filling in first outside, and then our long communal table that stretched the length of the dining room, they filled up every seat. The restaurant had a lot of energy. It was very loud. We left a two-top empty by the window. It was set as all of our tables were set with some flowers that we'd grown, napkins, silverware, paper placemats, some crayons. And around 6.30, a mob of secret service come through the front door, and they go to the bathroom, they go to the kitchen, they go to the dishroom, they're everywhere, they're probably in the basement, although I didn't have time to check. And one of them walked straight up to me. He seemed to be the person in charge, and he had a cooler in his left hand, and he extended his right hand, and he introduced himself. And I thought, there must be something so cool in that thing. And he said, I understand it's a dry town. The president's brought a bottle of wine for the first lady, and the fixings for his martini for himself. Where should I put them? We forgot an ice pack. So that broke the ice a little bit, and then he said to me, this is how it's going to go. Nobody can leave. Come or go when the president is eating. They're going to order off the menu like normal. You'll show me every ingredient before you cook it. If I tell you something to throw, if I tell you to throw something away, do so and start over. Any questions? No. So our team huddled up our kitchen team. At this point, we had one line cook, two teenagers, and a pastry chef who had come back, gotten through the Secret Service roadblock, was wearing sweatpants, and was probably stoned. I told them not to do anything different, and to ask me if they needed help. I went back to expediting, and the orders kept coming in, and their order came in. They had two salads to start. Sadie Dix was working the salad station that night, and she's a chill-marked kid like me. She was one of the teenagers. She'd never worked in a restaurant before that summer. So she proceeded to make... She's proceeded to dress these beautiful little lettuces with a puree of their own... with a puree of the same greens, salt, a little lemon juice, olive oil. She tossed it, and she finished it with sautéed shiitake mushrooms. They were all ingredients that her family had grown on their farm just down the road, and she plated them beautifully with nice architecture, nice and soft just as I taught her, and she looked at me, and I tasted them, and they were perfect. And I told her, now you should bring them out to the president. So she had an Orioles cap, cocked to the side, which the Secret Service had already given her a hard time about. And she walked past me, she walked past her parents who were eating at the bar, with a naive gracefulness that only a 16-year-old can have. And she delivered the food to the president, came back, smiled. I smiled at her. And the Secret Service men with the cooler who had been taking pictures all night, was snapping away pictures on his camera phone. When their main course came up, the president had a lobster, and the first lady had steamed muscles. He took pictures of that. The food went out, and he continued to take pictures. And I said, do you have to document everything? And he said, no, this is fucking cool. He said, he said, your food is beautiful. And he started showing me pictures of prawns from Africa, fish from the Caspian Sea, and the president's favorite pasta from Italy. They finished their meal with a blueberry coffee cake that Olivia made, and at this point was quite envious of. And he had a cup of coffee. They paid the bill. He had a firm handshake. She complimented the muscles, which a friend of mine had grown off the coast of Manempia, the same friend that had actually convinced me to leave the salad station at the feast of Chomark and join him in the dish pit. And I watched Sadie as she swept the floor that night, after service, happily. And I was reminded that we are the privileged ones to be born here, to be proud of where we're from. She and I both shared the same things growing up. We shared strength and sunburns and tan lines that don't come from afternoon spent on the beach. And Sadie put it best. She said, I wasn't just raised on a farm, but a farm raised me."
43,againstthewind.wav," Some of the best memories in my life, all come from this period of time that I remember as the Bachelor Days. They went like this, I'm six years old, and I'm cruising down the highway in the passenger seat, and in the driver seat, is my best friend and Bachelor buddy, my dad. And we're moving our lives from Boston to New York. And for the whole four hour drive, we're looking at each other, we have the tape deck turned up, and we're singing, ooh baby baby, it's a wild world. Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun. Hard to get by, just upon a smile girl. go go go go go go go go go. We played that tape, T for the Taylor Man, so much that summer, that we actually broke the tape, that was a thing that would happen. And then there was our anthem against the wind. We were running against the wind. We were young and strong and still running against the wind. Yeah, Bob Seager fans. That's it, that's my whole story. But that was our anthem, that was the soundtrack to the Bachelor Years. And our, the place that we are moving on Long Island our house wasn't ready. And because our house wasn't ready, we spent our summer in this little cramped Brooklyn Heights apartment. And in that place, we lived like two, 22-year-olds would live. We had no cookware, we had like one pan, and two mugs out of which we would drink instant soup, like as our meals. We had no furniture except for this inflatable bed that we would share every night. And each night we'd have to blow it up, but we'd have to take turns to make sure no one passed out. We'd be like, you're doing your turn, you're doing go, go. And the best part was we ate cereal, whenever the hell we wanted. You want Captain Crunch for dinner, son? Done! Like that was our, that was our life. And like two bros moving into a new apartment would make a point of serving the town, you know, their block for bars. We would cruise our entire neighborhood to draw a mental map of every toy store and comic bookstore in a 10 mile radius. Because in there was something more valuable than women. Action figures. So six-year-old me and my father would burst into these places like two robber barons like everybody free. Me and the boy, see we're looking for the new Greenland connection figure. Yes, the white one. Yes, the one with the light up ring. Hand it over, put it in the bag and we'll be on our way. And then he put me on his back and would be gone like that. And that's how I remember that summer. New action figure in hand on my way to Captain Crunch Dinner. Riding on the back of my father. The two of us. Now it was just the two of us because my mother had just died. Just a couple weeks earlier. Diagnosed with lung cancer in December, she made it just far enough to see me turn six. And then the summer began. And when I look back on that time, I'm struck by the dichotomy between what I remember as these golden, wonderful bachelor days and the actual harrowing truth of what was happening. There's just two guys. One of whom who had just lost his mother and one of whom who had just lost his wife. It's like finding an old cassette tape that you made. And you love this thing and you dust it off years later and you realize that there's a B side on there that you've never even listened to. Against the wind. We were running against the wind. And I realized that our soundtrack was actually my dad's morning songs. Or the songs that he used to make sure that he could keep going in the day. I think about, I must have thought, a thousand times about that summer on his back. But just now as I'm getting older, am I starting to think about the story of the person who was doing the carrying at the time? I wonder if he was scared. I wonder how he knew what to do when everything started falling apart. I wonder where in our little apartment he would go to cry so I couldn't see him. And I wonder how he was able to turn what should have been the most devastating period of my life into something I remember as my best days. Just taking pieces of rubble and making a world for me right on the fly. So now that I'm a real bachelor, drinking far more mug soup than I care to admit, I often wonder what kind of man will I become? Then I realize I already know."
44,lifereimagined.wav," I remember standing in line at the Social Security Office with my mama. I was 10 years old and the line moved ahead slowly. But I could hear the lady at the front of the line saying, Nakes, go to the desk, Nakes fill out the form. My mother and I got to the front of the desk and my mother looked at the form and she started to ask the lady a question. She said, Excuse me, can I and the lady cut her off and said, Ma'am, take the form, take it to the desk, fill it out and come back. Nakes. My mother looked at the form again and she looked at the lady and she started to ask her the question again. She said, Excuse me, ma'am, can I, the lady cut her off and say, Ma'am, we don't have time for this. Take the form to the desk, fill it out and bring it back. Nakes. My mother and I walked to the desk and my mother looked at the form and I could tell that water was starting to well up in her eyes and I said, Mama, what's wrong? And she said, Baby, Mama can't read. And I looked at her and I said, Ma'am, the first line it says, name. She said, Can you write that? I said, yeah. She said, My name is Andy Christian and I wrote out her name and the next line said address. I said, Mama, that's where we live. She told me I wrote it and we went all the way down the form this way until we got to the last line. And it had a word that I was not quite familiar with. It sounded like, sig, nature. And she said, What's that? I said, Mama, I think that's when you write your name real squiggly like. And she said, I can do that. And she did. And she looked at me and she started to cry and she hugged me real tight. And she said, You will never know what it's like to be ignorant. Now I didn't know what she was talking about. I'm 10 years old. All I know is I was doing something to help my mama. And because my mama and my dad had both were illiterate and they weren't there encouraged my reading. They decided to go out and buy me all of these pretty books. They had pretty pictures on them. So as a 10 year old, I started to gather up a real big collection of books. I had General Principles of Engineering, Ron L. Hubbard's Dionnetics, General Psychopathology, Sex After 60, and Green Eggs and Ham. So I was ready for the world with that. But my folks loved me enough that if I had decided to drop out of school and got a job working at the factory and stayed out of trouble with the police, they would have been happy for me. But I wanted more than that out of life. I wanted those things. I was reading in those books. And because I was a marginal student and a marginal athlete, there was little of no chance of me going to college or getting any kind of scholarship at all. But there was one organization that was offering me a job and that was the United States Army. Now thinking that the harder the job is, the more money you'd get paid, I say to the recruiter, give me the hardest job you got. And they did. I became a paratrooper. And I had never been on an airplane before in my life. Well at some point, the Army went from being my stepping stone in life to my island. And I decided to re-enlist. But no amount of toughness or hardness can help you get promoted in the military without education. And I remember how I would hear Army lawyers talk and other officers and just a turn of a phrase or you change a few words and somebody could get promoted or not promoted. You could be found guilty or not guilty. So I started thinking to myself, you know what, when I get out of the Army, I'm going to become a lawyer. I started telling everybody that. But most of the time when an officer heard me say something like that, they would just roll their eyes. But I would keep on saying it. In fact, one officer actually said to me, listen, you don't even have a college degree. You need to focus your attention on being a paratrooper that's your job. Well, from that point forward, I started taking college classes at night. I remember showing up the class dirty, bleeding, hurting, stinking, funky. But seven years from this period and two years after I actually retired from the Army, I did earn my bachelor's degree. Well, the first thing I did after that is I started applying to law schools. But it didn't take long before those little envelopes started to arrive. Rejection. We're sorry. Rejection. Rejection. But one day, a big envelope came in the mail. I was accepted to law school. I am going to law school. I told everybody, guess what? I am going to be a lawyer. I'm going to be a lawyer. I'm going to help the little guy. I'm going to help everybody. In fact, one of my friends in the Army said to me, hey, Ray, you think you could help me sue the Army? Hell, yeah. I'm helping everybody. I'm going to be a lawyer for everybody on earth. Well, when I got to law school, I was not the typical law student. Not at 38 years old. Not being a combat vet, not having PTSD and four children. I was different. And I mean, law school was hard. It was hard to help your kids with their algebra homework. The reading 200 pages a night was difficult. And I didn't make friends easily. But there were three older guys in the law school that became friends of mine. They started paling around with me. But almost right away, after the midterm exams were completed, I had failed everyone. And the only chance that I had now to finish law school was I had to ace all the final exams. It wasn't long after this period that I got this message that the assistant dean of the law school wanted to speak to me in his office. I went to his office and I remember he had his back turned to me when he said, you should withdraw. I said, I don't want to withdraw. I'm not going to quit. I spent my whole life thinking about this mostly. I'm not going to quit. He said again, you should withdraw. And if you should graduate, I'll eat my head. When I walked out of his office, I started thinking about what my mama had said. You'll never know what it's like to be ignorant. But I did in that moment. Later I saw the sign on the wall. It was announcing the Mary Wright closing argument competition. This is the highlight of the law school year. All the top law students and the law professors, they pick out these students, they want to mentor and they work on this competition. It is a big deal. The whole law school turns out to see it. And this is what I had came to law school for. This was like being a lawyer on TV. This is what I wanted to do. But I also knew that I wasn't doing well in law school. In fact, when a law professor heard that I was thinking about it, he said to me, look, you need to focus your attention on academics and not extracurricular activity. So at that point, I forgot about it. But my three older friends, they came to me and they said, hey, man, you ought to do it anyway. This is what we do. This is what you talk about. Come on, what do you got to lose? Try it. Try it. Okay. I'm in. But I couldn't get any law professors to work with me. And a few weeks prior to the competition, I hadn't really done anything at all. I wrote a few notes on a tissue paper and that's all the preparation I had. In the way the competition worked, you're standing outside and the whole law school is inside. You knock on the door, you go in, people would make their presentation, you'd hear applause. Next person would go in, make their presentation, you'd hear applause. Then my turn came. And when I went in, I knew that I couldn't talk about any fine points of the law. I couldn't talk about elements of torts. I couldn't talk to them about subject matter jurisdiction. But I could tell them a story. I could tell them about right and wrong. I could tell them about justice and injustice. And I closed with this line. And just like the boogeyman that lives under my girl's bed, made up from dust bunnies, buttons and lost Christmas toys, exposed to the light, the prosecution's case just isn't there. And I walked out. But I walked out to complete silence. But soon as the door closed behind me, I heard what sounded like thunder. And that was the sound of the entire law school applauding all at once. I never went back inside, but I couldn't help but cry. Well the final exams would come and they would go. And two weeks later I would find out I won the competition. But four weeks later I would find out I was being academically dismissed from law school. I was broken. I never felt so bad in my life. I thought about how embarrassed I was. I thought about all the people I was never going to help, all the things I was never going to do. And it took me a while to think to myself, maybe. Just maybe I did get a feather in my head. Maybe I did get a gold star. I mean, I beat out some of the smartest people in the law school at their own game. And if I hadn't had this stupid idea of becoming a lawyer, I would have never went to college. I'd never earned graduate degrees in history and education. I'd never would have became a college professor. I wouldn't be halfway completed with my dissertation right now. So the journey didn't take me to a place where I could knock out injustice in the courtroom. But the journey did take me to a place where I could combat ignorance in a classroom."
45,stumblinginthedark.wav," My story begins, I am driving my silver station Volvo from Brooklyn to my mother's house in Rosedale, Queens on a hot mid-A afternoon August day in 2003. My mother is a widow. My father has passed away from lung cancer 15 years before in 1988 and she has not resumed dating. She has sworn off men in no uncertain terms. She has told me that I am never ever going to wash another pair of men's underwear again. I am finished with the species undone. She is somewhere around 80 years old but I don't know for sure because she's never told me how old she is. Matter of fact on my birth certificate you can see that she has altered her age. I am very close with my mother. We have a very tight relationship. We've always had this bond, this complicity, this silent love between us. I check in with her almost every evening to make sure she is okay and to alleviate her loneliness. One afternoon when I was editing a film and there was around 12, 30, 1 o'clock and I felt this strange feeling in my body is if somebody was tapping me saying maybe you should check in on your mother and I stood up and I told my editor I have to call my mother. I called her up and she was having a heart attack. She said I'm fine, don't worry and she hung up. I called her back and I was able to get the ambulance and myself there in a nick of time. As long as I can remember I've always been my mother's protector against my father and my brother and the rest of the world and she also mine. I grew up in a very volatile house. My father was a World War II veteran. He suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome which wasn't really diagnosed in those days. My older brother who also had problems lived downstairs and as my father got sick from cancer he lost this booming voice and as his voice faded away my brother's voice in the basement rose. I could tell that this was not a good sign for things to come. You know when we grow up we all think we're going to get married, we're going to have our own family and we're going to leave the other family behind our siblings and our parents but it doesn't actually always occur that way. It's very hard to break those ties from the first family that formed you. Anyway we get into car my mother that day and we're going to visit my brother Ralph who no longer lives with my mother. He now resides at the Creedmore mental health state hospital and he's lived there for the last seven years. It's the psychiatric state hospital that's the one that's located in Queens, North Union Turnpike. Now he's not too happy about living there but that's where he's been there for the last seven years. He's been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic by polar obsessive compulsive borderline personality. Any diagnosis that's out there he's got it. Okay. This is you know how it's been. So he's also you know been to therapy. He's had shock treatments. He's at every combination of anti-psychotic drugs and all the side effects that go with it. The weight gain, the teeth loss, the tremors, the shaking, the stiffness, diabetes and this is you know this is the situation that he's in. When he's stable we're actually allowed to take him out on a pass and he loves to go out on passes because we take him shopping and he gets something to eat because he doesn't like the food there and he also loves to go to the hair salon. My brother Ralph's hair is very important to him. He doesn't have many teeth but his hair has to be done just so. If it's not just so his emotional state plummets and then we have to deal with that. So we're we're on the way to Creedmore and Creedmore was a place. He lives in building 40. It's 17 story building. He's in the lock facility on the 11th floor and Creedmore when we were kids we used to pass on the parkway with my father and it was a place where the boogeyman lived. There was a place where all the crazy people lived and used to say you know you don't want to wind up in Creedmore and that that was what we said to each other and now it's my brother's home and this is actually the first time I've ever spoken about it in public. So we get there. You have to go through two sets of doors which then you're locked into and I walk to the elevator. I press the button because it's on the 11th floor. Look at the bank of lights and as we're waiting for the elevator to descend in the lobby with the security personnel the lights go out. We don't know what happened. We're all looking around and it's two years after 9-11. Everyone's a little jeery we're thinking hey maybe this could be another attack or something and lots of most people don't have cell phones. I don't have a cell phone. About 10 minutes later they'd say it's a blackout. It's the blackout of 2003 which affected I think 50 million people and knocked out Ontario and eight states here in America but we don't know this at the time. We know that all I know is that my brother has a pass and he wants to go out and he's looking forward to it. So I asked the guys can they call upstairs and talk to the doctor and they do when they say I can I can go up there. So I asked my mother I said listen you wait down here I go upstairs. I start walking up the 11th they're very long flights it's kind of dark. You know I'm thinking you know what a roller coaster mental illness is not just for the patient but for everyone else involved. It's a sentence that you're given and it's a life sentence and it's you know there's all the things that you have to go through the the the doctors the drugs the violent outbursts the destruction literally and emotionally the police coming to your house the shame that you live with it just goes on and on it's not like those movies like a beautiful mine when someone reaches out and says well you know let me all you need is love you know you know love is a given but it's a war of attrition it really is it's a long endless baseball season that never ever ends it goes on and on and really what it is it's this grind you have to have unbelievable patience and this emotional fortitude to survive and it it kills a lot of people and that's why you see so many people out on the street because they become their families flee and I don't blame them and they become awards of the state so anyway that's what's going through my mind as I come up and knock on the door my brother's happy to see me I talked to the doctor and then his friend this young thin black man Isaiah who draws his life every day he storyboards his entire existence comes over and shows me his latest masterpiece and I thought it's very nice Isaiah as I'm trying to deal with my brother and the doctor and he whispers in my ear can I come to with you and I said Isaiah listen I I love to I love to take you but you know it's a blackout and I'm going to take Ralph okay so the doctor says okay so we go down as stairs we have to go down slow because my brother can't see so well because he had an altercation with a very huge patient who was an ex-prisoner from Rikers Island and the guy satvishly beat him and now he's blind in one eye so I have to take him down so I come down with my brother and my mom was getting older come outside and of course we've brought him cigarettes now I'm worried about the time because it was 4-10 when the blackout happened by now it's around 5 o'clock but my brother is in no hurry I'm worried about the light anyway so I give him a cigarette he can't have one cigarette he has to have one after another and another and he smokes him down to the very tiny bit end and when you give him the pack you have to open it just so everything to according to his specifications otherwise he will take the cigarettes out and break them and that's kind of how symbolic of my relationship with him much of the time I buy him cigarettes he breaks them I buy him a CD player he rips off the cover I renovate my mother's house he burns it down we get in the car he has to sit in the backseat over here so I can see him in the mirror because it's precarious my mother sits here she's never driven so she doesn't know that much about driving but I want to keep my eye on him so I'm driving there are no stop lights I have to make sure I keep my eye on my brother who sometimes can punch the window at a frustration and I have to figure out where am I going it's a blackout you know I what am I going to do I know he's hungry so my mother says you know why don't you make a left turn and I'm in the far right lane I say mom it's you know I can't go over three lanes like that but she seems kind of oblivious it's getting later we see the diner that we normally go to we pull in there's no one in there but it seems open so we get out and the guy looks at us we walk in he's this big Greek guy with a walk a walrus moustache and I say are you serving and he says blackout he goes he says they blackouts I know it's a blackout he says my brother says looks at me goes I want a cheeseburger he goes no cheeseburger blackout coffee so my mother tries to you know alleviate referee the situation she says when the stove is going to you must have a gas stove he says pilot light electric coffee no cheeseburger you know so my brother of course keeps asking for the cheeseburger then he says what about french fries and the guy goes no no no so my mother and my brother look at him incredulously like look at this guy what a weakling there's a blackout and he falls like a cheap suit you know anyway I'm looking at the clock you know it's getting later you know I get him in a car after another cigarette we're driving everything is closed it's like a ghost town because people worry when there's a blackout they remember 1977 the the stores are closed the restaurants are closed even the hassle on is closed which is very upsetting throughout we just keep driving and driving I'm going okay you know it's going to get darker you know and we don't know where we're going you know plus I have my own family back in Brooklyn my wife and two kids so finally I see a little pizzeria on the corner and I pull over and I said wow I jump out looks open I run in and the guy has a wood burning oven you know and he says yes I'm open he's an Italian guy of course so that's good uh uh so I get them to come out we sit outside on a table and we order a brick oven pizza and warm soda and you know it they they come it takes a long time and you know I'm looking at my mother and thinking wow she's she's getting older you know and I'm looking at my brother thinking you know what's going to happen after she's gone you know who's who's going to take care of him and I'm the middle child and one of three boys and I'm the responsible one you know for good and for bad and I think well I I'm going to be alone with him one day and it's going to just be me and him and my brother looks at me and he's very perceptive when he's calm he can spot a person's weakness with startling accuracy and speed like

stumbling along in the dark searching trying to reach some kind of home you know while we're juggling all these balls hopefully keeping them afloat"
46,waitingtogo.wav," It was standing on the Millennium Bridge in the center of London. It was 2 a.m. It was quiet. I could hear the water sloshing below me and the traffic in the distance. It was dark. It was never really dark in London. You could see the lights, the buildings, beside the river. The St. Paul's to my right, Grand M Majestic, and the tape to my left. It was summer, but it was getting cold. I was anxious, agitated, and leaning against the railing of the bridge. I remember this moment. It's frozen in my mind because I wanted it to be my last moment. I thought I had just completely failed my exams at the end of the first year of university. I was feeling isolated, not part of the crowd. I was still a virgin, and I thought my whole life had just been a failure. I was always anxious and unhappy as a child. I remember crying in the playground at some simple game because someone might possibly get hurt. I remember after they showed one of those child safety videos being terrified of child snatches and anxious to walk around my friend's house in our small rural Suffolk village. I remember lying on my bed on Saturday afternoon, feeling listless and lost in low mood, but not knowing how to get out of it. I remember being picked on and called out for being awkward and ill-fitting and unable to stand up for myself at school. My escape from that was always the approval of the teachers. For all my frailties of mind and scattered decisions making, I was always intelligent and obedient enough to draw praise from adults. Maybe that's what damn me. I was 18, I moved to London to study physics and piracolage to understand the universe even as I little understood my own mind and my own emotions. And I was hopeful for a change for the new setting to break my old habits. And things did improve that year. I made a new set of friends, I went out and partied more. I learned a lot, gave a larger measure of independence. But the borders of my anxiety still remain jagged. And they still helped me back from things big and small, like finding love and stupid simple stuff. Like I remember lying on my bed in halls and hearing my sink gurgle and a strange sewer smell filled the room. And thinking I should really go and tell someone and get that fixed. And then being manningly terrified about the idea of that conversation and then thinking I'll do it next week, then the next, and then never. And delay had always been my way of dealing with my anxiety and eliciting into the other areas of my life. But delay isn't a very good response. The first year studying physics with theoretical physics. And you've got a lot of problems to do and no one to tell you to do them. And with that delay came a tide of self-hatred which gradually swallowed me whole. And as I got towards the end of the year, I couldn't see a way out and I started to think about killing myself. And as I got closer to the exams, that feeling grew of dread and I started planning. And as I decided I would jump, I thought it would be simple, quick, clean. And I picked the Millennium Bridge because I knew it would be quiet and I was embarrassed and afraid of getting caught in the moment. More embarrassed and afraid, somehow than the dying itself. And the exams came and I thought, didn't go well. And my friends began to drift off at the end of the year. And I didn't plan any big farewells, but maybe there was some more poise in my goodbyes. And maybe they knew something was up. I would occasionally drop out of social events or seam down, but I never reached out and asked for help. And so I finally reached what I planned to be my last day. It was the Sunday. I don't remember a lot about it. I remember cleaning my room and trying to leave things neat and tidy for when I was gone. I remember procrastinating on cleaning my room and playing video games. I think it's very difficult to really live any day as you're last, because your mind can't really compare the idea of not existing, of nothingness. And you just catch yourself thinking, I'll do that next week. And finally, I closed up my room. I walked from my halls near Edgrey Road to Imperial College, to the Millennium Bridge in the Centre for London. And I picked a route which was self-consciously poetic, past Hy Park, past Becking Palace, lit up in lights, past St. James's. And as a walk, I was filled with a mix of abject terror and determination. I felt I had unique knowledge that I was a terrible, inhuman, destructive figure, even though other people couldn't see it. I was almost pleased with myself that was somehow eliminating a problem as I saw it then. But beneath that, there were doubts still bubbling. So I reached the bridge. I walked onto the bridge, and then I delayed, going anxious, my stomach turning between living and dying, holding onto the railing, looking out, when people pass trying to look normal and casual. And then eventually, I walked one side of the bridge across the short width, and then I ran across the width of this bridge, remember my blutes clanking on the metal. I pushed myself up on the railing, my hips hit the railing, I remember tipping over, and the feeling of my feet kicking flew. And then a frozen moment which I can still see. I am airborne, and feeling a strange sensation of weightlessness. I'm looking down at the water, and I'm thinking of f***ing, I've really done it. That weird stomach feeling, something you imagined, seen on TV, or thought about, is really happening to you right now. And I had an almost resigned acceptance of it. Maybe this was the wrong decision, but it was happening. And I hit the water with a hard slap, and I plunged deep down into the stems, and I found myself kicking up and swimming. I'd learnt to swim from an early age, sat day morning lessons followed by a greasy spoon sessions, my parents. And I wasn't supposed to do this, I was supposed to hold tight, but my body made another decision. And then I was floating on my back down the stems, another frozen moment. I could see the light peaking over the embankment. I was very cold, I was wet through into my boots, and I was trying to decide what to do next. I thought about letting go and trying to drown, but I realised I didn't have the commitment with that. And I thought passes through my mind, forget, all just live. And I roll onto my front, and I see as the current pushes me, another bridge coming up, black fires. I managed to catch myself in the support, and see a ladder further down in the water, and catch onto that as I pushed past it, and haul myself out of the muddy water. And I'm standing on the embankment, it's 3am, I'm soaked through, I'm feeling angry that I'm still alive, I'm feeling kind of lost what to do next, and the shock of what's just happened. And I decided the only thing I know to do is to walk back to halls. So I take off back through London. And as I walk, I try and process what's just happened, and decide what to do next. And the specter of dying seems to have resized the idea of failing exams. I'm thinking maybe I'll stick around for a while longer, and suddenly I'm confronting the idea of having a future, of having to deal with the next year of living, and maybe even 60 years of living I might likely have. And I'm still embarrassed that I've done this, and I'm still alive. And I'm comforted to discover that London is exactly the kind of city, which you can walk through in the middle of the night, soaking wet, dressed in all black, and no one will pay attention to you. And I sneak back into halls, and I go to bed. And it's been 11 years since that night. And if I'm being honest, I'm still anxious, so lonely, I still struggle with stupid stuff, like phoning the council to order more liners for your food waste bin. And there's still a part of me, which tells me that I'm a terrible person, and didn't deserve to survive. But when I look back on that night, I realized my suicidal depressed brain made a load of predictions, which my life has varied from immensely in good and bad ways. Four years later, I graduated from Imperial with a first in physics. And maybe I shouldn't have listened to that voice. I watched Waiting for Godot recently, and reflecting on this story, these lines stick with me. Esther Gron says to Vladimir, I can't go on like this. To which Vladimir replies, that's what you think."
47,seedpotatoesofleningrad.wav," Okay, let's move on to the seed potatoes of Leningrad. One of the more promising features of the Anthropocene is that in the last few hundred years, human life has become far less violent. In Italy, to take one example, people were almost twice as likely to be murdered in 1913 than in 2013. But the further you go back in history, the more violent life becomes. In 1550, the Italian homicide rate is estimated to have been 25 times higher than it is today. Death from war has also become less common. Despite the two world wars, humans in the 20th century were less likely to die in battle than in any previous century in history. And yet, the world wars were also terrifyingly and relentlessly violent, and no nation suffered more than the Soviet Union. In World War II, over 8 million Soviet soldiers died, and over 13 million civilians. For context, 405,399 Americans died in World War II. In fact, if you add together all the American deaths from all the wars in the history of the United States, about 1.4 million Americans have died from war. More than 1.6 million Soviet citizens died in a single city in World War II. During the 872-day siege of Leningrad, a port city in northwestern Russia, today known as St. Petersburg. By the time World War II broke out, the Soviet Union had amassed by far the world's largest seed bank, a collection of over 250,000 samples of agricultural crops from rice to wheat to berries, under the leadership of the botanist Nikolai Vavilov, who served as the director of the Leningrad Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and of the Institute of Plant Industry, which might be the two most thoroughly Soviet institution names of all time. Vavilov and his colleagues believe that the preservation of seed varietals could help the Soviet Union and the world to develop crops more resistant to droughts and pests, and in doing so end human starvation. They traveled the world collecting seeds and cuttings, most of which were stored in vaults at the Institute of Plant Industry. But more than 6,000 varieties of potatoes and other tubers were maintained outside the city at the Pavlov's Experimental Station, overseen by two agricultural scientists, Abraham Kamaraz and Olga Voskhrinskaya. As the Germans began to bomb the outskirts of the city in the summer of 1941, Kamaraz and Voskhrinskaya frantically harvested potatoes at the experimental station as bombs fell in the fields around them. Then they took the potatoes into the city, where with colleagues they boxed up thousands more seeds and cuttings. They got what they could out of the city and then hunkered down in a building on St. Isaac's Square with the remainder of their collection. By then they knew that their boss and mentor Nikolay Vavilov had disappeared, like so many others installed in Soviet Union, but they did not know that Vilov was in a prison where he would starve to death in 1943. The responsibility for protecting the collection fell to Kamaraz and Voskhrinskaya and their colleagues in Leningrad. Within days the Axis powers had surrounded the city, cutting off all supply routes. Hitler expected the siege to last a few weeks before starvation resulted in surrender. After that the Nazis planned to destroy the city and its people. One Nazi directive read in part, there can be no interest in the continued existence of this large urban center. But for the Nazis there was an interest in the seeds. Hitler was obsessed with securing land for agriculture and improving yields through better seeds. And the Nazis tasked a special SS commando unit with finding and securing Vavilov seed collection. Bombardment began almost immediately. After a thousand civilians were killed in a single day, September 19, 1941. But most of the civilians who died during the siege of Leningrad starved. In that first winter civilians in Leningrad had fewer than five ounces of bread per day per person to eat, and it was extremely poor quality. In many cases the bread was over 50% sawdust. Hitler was destroyed making it difficult to seek medical attention or travel to receive what little food rations were available. One diarist wrote, only skeletons, not people. Another recalled his father, dying from hunger, crying out, where is my body? During the bitterly cold winter of 1941-1942, a hundred thousand people in besieged Leningrad died each month. One woman was so thin, she was mistakenly stacked with corpses until her husband insisted she was still breathing. Their son Victor had already died of diphtheria during the siege. But the couple both survived and went on to have another son in 1952 named Vladimir Putin. One detail has always stuck with me from my readings about the siege of Leningrad. All paper paste had often been made from potato starches, so all through the city people stripped wallpaper from their homes, removed the paste, and boiled it to make soup. Meanwhile the disciples of Vaveelov had thousands of varieties of rice and wheat. They had thousands more edible seed potatoes that cameras in Voskranskaya had saved. But what you eat now, you cannot plant later. The seed bank workers had to save their specimens first from the Nazis that Commando unit never got to the collection. But also from their starving compatriots in Leningrad who were desperate with hunger. Then there were the rats and mice. People reported that the rodent population was worse than normal that first winter because people had resorted to eating all the cats. The potatoes were the hardest of all because they required warmth if they froze through they would die. It was scarce in winter, but the first fuel went to keep the seed potatoes warm. Working in shifts the seed bank scientists stayed with their collection 24 hours a day, feeding the fire, and protecting the seeds. Years later one of the workers, Vatim Letschnovic, was asked if it was hard to keep from eating the rice and wheat and potatoes all around him. And he replied, it was hard to walk. It was unbearably hard to get up every morning to move your hands and feet. But it was not in the least difficult to refrain from eating up the collection. What was involved was the cause of your life, the cause of your comrades lives. Peanut specialist A.G. Stuken died at his desk in the building on St. Isaac Square, an un eaten package of peanuts in his hand. Dmitri Ivanov, who oversaw the rice collection at the seed bank, died of starvation at his post, surrounded by bags of rice. The keeper of the oat collection, Ilia Rodina, died, as did Gregori Krier, who managed the herb collection, and both Abraham Kamaraz and Olga Voskrenskaya, the potato saviors. Altogether, at least a dozen of the institute scientists starved to death during the siege. They probably could have survived on that collection of seeds, but instead the seeds survived. In many cases, they were the only examples of their particular varietal. And we still use those seeds. Decades after World War II, for instance, the descendants of some seeds that survived the war were used to replenish seed stocks following drought and Ethiopia. When blight comes or the climate changes, we turn to seed banks, including the Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry, which is still in St. Isaac Square, all these decades later. Humans are often criticized for being short-term thinkers, unable to see past their own lives. But yes, in desperate situations, we can become desperate animals. But it is also human to die for want of potatoes that you are saving for people you do not know. Every seed contains a possibility of life yet to come. And when given the choice between themselves today, or everyone tomorrow, the seed bank workers of Leningrad, chose us. Let us remember their example. I give the seed potatoes of Leningrad, 4.5 stars."
48,dialogue4.wav," What was it like for you to come here to the US? I didn't know besides good morning and what's your name when I came here. And when you were baby, I used to read to you that Dr. Sus books like one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish. And that's how I learned English, reading to you. You know, I never really put in much thought that you were an immigrant. I just thought, you know, you're my mom. And I never thought that you would have to leave. I was at school when my phone buzzes and I just saw the notification that TPS was going to terminate. And I remember I started crying when you called me. I tried to call me down. I am like, okay, this is happening. It's really happening. So I put myself together because I knew that I have to be strong for you. And I didn't promise something that I cannot keep. So I didn't promise you that everything will be okay, but I promise I'm going to make sure that you are okay. What are you most afraid of? I terrified of me seeing you growing up, staring by. I think that I'm more afraid of that than to go back to my country. Yeah. I'm scared that I'm going to have to do everything by myself. You're not going to be alone. I promise to you that. And I'm very hard to get rid of. So I'm going to be on the phone all the time. What are your hopes for the future? That I'm going to die of an old age and be the pain on your neck all the time. And make sure that you find strength even in a bad moment. And I think of my earliest memories, I think of asking you homework assignments and you looking at my textbooks and falling in love with the textbook and reading it almost from cover to cover and only answering my question hours later. So where does that come from? When I was young, I'll give you an incident how I'm hooked into this book business. When I'm nine or eight, when my parents give me one rupee, which is like $1. And what I do with that, I don't buy candy or anything. I just go to a stall where they sell children books and I like all of them. So I ask what this one rupee can buy. So once I get eight books, then I become home, you know what I do. Even today I do this. I don't start reading the first page. I smell it. I know you do. I remember that. Yeah, you're seeing it many times. I've seen you do that many, many times. The fresh book printed from the press untouched. I open. I smell it. That's my connection with the book. The book became my friend. Better than my friends, you know, human friends, I feel that the author is talking to me in person. Now if I go and ask him for wisdom, he's a big guy. He may not talk to me. But now he's coming to me. And he says, I'm here. I'm talking. Listen to me. The book could be written in any language. It can say anything. It's a transfer of knowledge from one person to the other. It doesn't force you to read. But it is there. That book in my point of view is very sacred. You have to read all books. Keeping an open mind. Open mind. Next time you'll think, well, wait a minute. There's another viewpoint there. If you want to give anybody something, the very best, give a book. It opened for me how to live. What do you remember about our first date? Well, I got in the car and you said, now don't get excited, Jackie. But my pet snake is loose in this car. And I'm not a snake person. But you toughed out. I toughed out. You were a hot number for me. We dated for two years. And then we decided to a lope. I remember you didn't want your mother and daddy to know where we're going. So you threw your clothes out the window. I did. And just as we were getting ready to leave, Ivy Pope called and said he had killed a strange bird in his lake and wanted me to come and look at it. So we went over to Ivy Pope's lake and he had just killed a duck. And by then it was night. And we had to go to the judges' house. And when we got there, he was drunk. Well, he wasn't exactly drunk. He was just kind of wobbling. Well, he was feeling real good. Yeah, he was feeling good. Well, I must have been crazy in love to go through this. We seldom ever have an argument. But if it is, it's about something like an elephant's eye. But I'll say right here that you do know a lot. Well, I'll be. I need to record that. Tell me the story about Spencer. There was this big possum on the side of the road. And he wasn't hurt at all except his dead. So I said, well, he'll make an ice mount. So I got out and mad at him hanging based tail. And I never thought Spencer would be a celebrity. You know, Tyler Pussett before it was in corporate, he used to be called possum snout. So the people, they said, let's have a possum drop on New Year's Eve. We thought it was stupid. But you just never seen such an arm. They start cheering and carrying on. And they'll knock you down and get over there to get a picture of Spencer. People give you more credit for Spencer than anything else. Well, let me tell you, a man or a woman is blessed if they can go to work every morning and enjoy it. And I'm just real happy that I've had a partner all of these years that I wouldn't trade for anybody. Thank you. Life has not been dull with you, bud. Well, I know that. But when you got in the car that night, you should have known. I know, I do. That should have been my first clue is what my life was going to be like. Thank you, Jackie. And I love you. I love you, most. When I came through the door, I was scared to death. I didn't know what to do. I had never been homeless before it. But I remember seeing your face. And I was shocked. I go, Barbara, not wave to you. People were really astonished. Because they said, oh, you two know each other. So we go way back. So from that day, my whole life just felt easier. It helped me to be able to talk to somebody, believe it or not, who was like me. We were like big sister, little sister, sounding boy, coach, therapist for each other the whole time. I remember when we first started talking about getting an apartment together. We said, no, no. And then I remember when I said to you, no, Barbara, we really need to consider this roommate thing. We're both in the same position. We both need each other. And I just wanted to feel a part of a home, not feel so this is my home, this is your home, it's our home. So we were able to get a place together. What I did learn is you don't have to be alone. And meeting that day in that shelter, honestly, I felt like for once, divine intervention was in my favor. I don't know where I would be if you and I didn't run into each other at the shelter. Me either. This was a true test, a friendship and time. And we've still had each other's back. We've come a long way. And I can't bathe in my life without you. Well, I've lost three partners to HIV and AIDS over the years. Tell me about Michael. My first met him. I was in the army and oh, he was handsome. He was extremely intelligent and vicious. He loved everybody. How did Michael find out he had AIDS? He took a test. I came in from work and he was crying. And I knew instantly he was HIV positive. And I told Michael, I'm still here and I'm not going any place. And you were just starting a relationship. You could have gotten run very easily, but you stayed for nine years. The last two years of his life, I was his caregiver. Then when he died, I cleaned him up, changed his clothes. And then I called his mom. Hardest thing I ever did. After Michael died for a while, I was a basket case. How did you get through that? It was his idea that I moved the letter off afterwards because we knew that the end was coming. And I moved. And then a few months later, I met you. And one reason I love you so much is you know what I went through with Michael. And you don't feel threatened. For me, the fact that you stayed with him and that you cared about him, that made me feel really, really secure with our relationship. If we had rough times or if I were sick, you'd stay with me. You are one of the most loving and caring people I have ever met in my life. And you show me that you love me every single day. You tell me that you love me every single day. Because you never know how many days you have left. I promise you that at the very end, the last face I want to see is when I look up at you. Same here. I think close my eyes forever."
49,catfishingstrangerstofindmyself.wav," More than a decade ago, when I was growing up in Finland, my model of an attractive woman was Pamela Anderson from Baywatch. She was my father's favorite. Whenever the boys at school asked me who I googled when my parents weren't home, I said Pamela, and the name was greeted with a unanimous nodding of heads. I didn't care much for a nude shot, but I liked that she was a Finnish heritage. My non-sexual feelings for Pamela were just one of the things that made me an outcast. Another was that I preferred computers to people. And so as a child who loved playing board games, I soon discovered I could play them online with strangers on a Finnish gaming website. To access this site, you typed in your username in the blank field, waited for a slot to open, and then found yourself in the main chatroom, where you could challenge people to a round of Blackjack, or Keino, or Billiards. Except it seemed no one else was there to play those games seriously. The screen was a constant stream of dirty messages. I realized no one wanted to message with a boy in his early adolescence, but many were clamoring to chat with an attractive woman. And that's where Pamela came in. To answer his fellow gamers, I needed to become a woman. Using Pamela's age and some of her defining features to create my new persona, I logged into the chatroom as charlotta, double D35. Then the messages came pouring in. I accepted an invitation to play Billiards from Jarkgo25, a screen popped up, and we were escorted into a private room where a question from him appeared in the message box. Are you feeling frisky? Why do you ask? I typed. Is it tight? He asked. I didn't entirely understand what he meant, but I knew it was dirty. I waited a moment and then wrote, yes. Nice. He replied, age. 35. I wrote, but I love younger men. That's hot. What do you look like? I quickly Googled Pamela plus Anderson and described what I saw on the search results. 179 centimeters blonde. I like to wear heels and tight dresses. Hmm. Do you have big breasts? Yes. Deacups? Yes. I was determined to give them everything he wanted. What sort of men do you like? Yes. Thinking of James Bond movies, I said, someone like Pierce Brosnan, someone who takes charge, someone stylish. I can definitely take charge. He said, I took a sip of my cool head. Six pack, I asked. Now it was the time for me to be demanding, otherwise it wouldn't seem real. Having a six pack was a thing I had heard was desirable. Not really. He said, but I have one in the fridge. I laughed. Maybe he was a nice guy. What followed was my first ever cyber sex session with him typing suggestive remarks and me typing, mm, would seem to work for him. My masquerade went on for months. I became a master of giving men what they wanted. The sheer number of interested men, man, I could be picky, too. I wanted a conventionally handsome and sexy young man. And since I was a woman of such high caliber, I didn't think it was too much to ask. I tailored my story to suit the other participants' interests. I was married with two children. I had a rich husband who couldn't satisfy me sexually. We lived in an enormous glass house with a private beach in one of Helsinki's most exclusive suburbs. And since I was a board, lonely housewife, I always needed someone to come over and take care of things. I found amateur photos of naked women online to send to the men and patched up whatever incongruities emerged. The picture doesn't have a face because I don't want my husband to find out I've been posting my photos online. Or I never give my number to strangers until I've gotten to know them well enough. The backstory also allowed me to in escape in case my parents got home. My husband just walked in, so I have to go now. I would say, can't wait to talk to you soon. I liked this online seduction much more than I imagined I would. I told myself it was the danger of getting caught, of fooling the men, of breaking rules, whatever the case. I'd become addicted every day after school. I would continue my quest for the perfect man. That's when I came across UC. He described himself as a man who was 23, loved the gym, and had a six pack. He played ice hockey and basketball, masculine sports. I'd always wanted to be good at. But he was emotive, too. He sent me messages such as, you sound like an incredible woman. And I can sense such warmth in these messages of yours. He asked me the usual questions, what are you wearing? Where do you like to do it? How do you like it? I provided my usual answers. I was wearing nothing. I just got out of the shower and like to cool my body naturally. I like doing it on every surface of the house and particularly in public places. All the yoga I did made me incredibly flexible. And I loved being lifted up and twisted into adventurous sexual positions. But then he began to talk about what he hoped to find on the site, namely a relationship that was real and meaningful. I agreed I was tired of sleeping around, too. Usually I blocked a man once he began to insist on meeting in person, but you see was patient and sweet. I wanted to continue talking to him. We logged in at the same time day after day. I adjusted the schedule around my school days by saying, I'll need to drop the kids off first. So I won't be home until 3 p.m. tomorrow. He worked at night shifts as a security guard. So he was always online when I needed him to be. After a few weeks, he said, can we meet already? Please, Charlotte. He told me that he was tired of chatting and that if I didn't say yes, he wouldn't believe I was a real person. What we had was real to me. And I didn't want to disappoint him. So I agreed. We set a date for 7 p.m. a week later. We agreed to meet on a street corner in the center of Helsinki, mere blocks from where I lived. I hoped we would recognize each other simply because we had been talking for so long and had such a strong connection. As the days passed, however, the impossibility of it began to dawn on me. Even if I were to go meet him and get past the initial explanations, I could never become what he imagined me to be. And something else dawned on me as well. I was starting to realize I might be gay, and that's why I was different from everyone else. At 7 p.m. that evening, my mother put sausages and French fries on the table for dinner. I sat in silence, answering her questions with an absent-minded yes, or no. Looking at the clock, it hit me. UC was now standing out in the cold night alone. I wondered how long he would wait. 20 minutes, 30 full hour. Would he camp out at a nearby cafe while wistfully looking out of the window, searching the passing crowd for Charlotte's face? I imagined him sitting on the bus on his way home to the suburbs, hoping there'd been a mix up. I'd either forgotten the day or mistaken the time. I imagined him logging onto the chatroom and scanning the list for my username, only to come up empty. I'd blocked him to make sure I didn't have to read through any excruciating messages. A couple of hours after dinner, my mother came to knock on my door to tell me it was bedtime. As I lay alone in the dark, I felt the same loneliness UC must have been feeling. I wish there had been a way for me to tell him what his online companionship meant to me, that he had made it possible for me to be myself in a strictly gendered world of Pamela Anderson's and James Bond's, that he had helped me believe I was funny, interesting, and worth talking to, that he had, if only by his presence, made it possible for me to begin to process my sexuality. By pretending to be someone I was not, I had shown him my true self when I had been too afraid to reveal to anyone else. And ultimately, I was able to embrace that true self, an acceptance that would allow me years later, as an adult in New York City, to find real love as a real person."
50,dialogue3.wav," When Martin Luther King was assassinated, my father was pacing back and forth and he was emotional. I'd never seen him like that. So I ran back to my mother and I'd said, Dad, he's in their crime. Dad is in their crime. And she's like, it's okay, baby. Give him some time. That was only nine months before your father himself was killed in the same way. Now he was a really busy civil rights leader. So he wasn't home all that much. But your father spent his last day with you. He played snowballs with you and took you under your little sled and spent that whole day with you. I remember I heard my mother cry at when and I sat up in the bed and I was immediately engulfed in fear. My mom and I rushed over there and when I saw that front door was open, I knew. I knew. I'll never forget walking into that family room and I could see your dad laying there. And of course he was totally still. He died instantly. Then you came and got me and I know everything was going to be alright. You guys never lived again in their house. After his death, I was always frightened that whoever that was might try to come get us. She didn't really talk to me about him. If I brought him up, it would make her sad. She kept a photo album with all of the pictures of the assassination and so I learned about him. Basically reading that. I wish she'd been able to talk to you about him though. Me too. About his sense of humor. His astonishing singing voice. Right. And he was somebody who was quiet but had all the power in the room. I get sad but I don't stay in that frame of mind because my parents didn't stay here long but while they were here, they did everything humanly possible to make this a better world before they left it. That's right. My father has a Southern draw. I'm James Laby-Coy Brown and I'm here with my daughter. I'm Shotsie Harris. I think of Gossimini Sam. I'm as like he's trying to be funny but that's just his real voice. You were with me until I was three years old. Yeah. When I got off work every night, I'd pick you up from the daycare center and I always brought you on. That's great big huge lollipops. And then you kept disappearing on me. I showed you the pictures of my house. You know, here's the basement I fixed up for you and you said I'm going to be living like a king. He rescued me. It's John T. Do you ever worry about me living here with you? I do. I have two young girls and I don't always feel like you're the best influence on them. It's just that you're a little rough around the edges and uncouth and used to be in homeless and not used to anybody, especially not your daughter telling you what you can and can't do. It's hard but I'm working on it. I don't pee in the back yard anymore. The good outweighs the bad. You have tea parties with my daughters. Yeah. So many favorite moments between us. Which one pops into your head first? That night I was feeling real bad and you held my hand until I went to sleep. And you said, Dad, you can stay with me as long as you want to. I didn't know that meant so much to you. Yeah. What are your hopes for me? I hope that your mental illness either stays stable or improves. I hope that you can continue to live with us. Family Christmas is family birthdays. We have so many years to make up for. I'm going to try my hardest to make sure that I don't lose you again because you're good at that disappearing act. I'm lucky to have you back in my life. I love you. Dad and I lost contact only a few months after the interview. I absolutely want to reunite with him again. And it's in the back of my mind that he's going to be already dead and I'm going to find that public record. That's a crushing thought. But one of the things that keeps me going is I have a little of a stubborn will and there's something powerful between a father and a daughter that mental illness and time hopefully can't break. I was a contractor and I was asked to come rewire the house and somewhere you asked did I want tea. I had five jobs going on at the same time. I'm smoking two packs of cigarettes a day and didn't have time for none of that but out of my mouth came yes. And you drank tea with me and you fixed my switch. Free of charge. Free of charge. And I knew you were looking at me and I never met anyone who had such a gentleness and a firmness at the same time. It wouldn't let me look deep into his eyes. I wanted to finish the job so that I could fire myself from the job then I would engage and deal with you. So we didn't see each other for a while. And then we went for ice cream. That was our first date. I'm thankful to God every day since. And I remember in conversation you told me Walnut Street was a place historically where African American entrepreneurs have resided and in this area there were Elm trees up and down the block that kissed in the middle of the street. Right. So it was very direct on this block right because most of the homes were bored and Christmas Eve. We were sitting in the kitchen looking out and you said what's going on with those flickering of those lights and it was crack pipes. We looked at each other and said this is not right. It's not right. And you said I want you to do that house please. I just say please right. Oh absolutely. Your eyes always say please. That was the first renovation on this block. So the renovation of our own home became secondary to the renovation of our community. And there is such a blessing in the commitment that you and I have for each other. And I get great joy when that commitment manifests itself. Block by block, household by household. Before I was renovating homes but to take it deeper to renovate communities is a purpose for life. I love you. Love you too baby. I saw everybody running in every direction and in the blink of an eye everyone was gone. I remember being thrown into the ROTC room and I was told to go in the back lay down be quiet. You didn't know yet. I don't think anybody really knew. I was on 10% and dad was texting me. He said what's going on? I said I don't know. Do you see police? I said no idea. And he said are you out of school and then my phone dead. And we were fighting that morning. I don't remember why. I remember being like my mom spat at me and like I'm never going to say I'm sorry. After this what came into my class they had us run with our heads down and our hands on our heads and they're like don't look to your right. Don't look to your right. And obviously if somebody tells you not to do something and you're a bunch of teenagers you're going to do it. And the doors were open and there were backpacks all inside and it was red and like everything was a mess. When you say red meaning blood. I saw you and I was able to touch feel hug you. I remember just like not wanting to let go. What was your experience when you finally saw us? I didn't really think like I'm so glad to see you. I just wanted to leave. And I remember we went home and I was texting Alyssa and I was like where are you or you okay and Alyssa never texted back. So I was just praying. Just let her be okay and she wasn't. How did you feel about sending me back to Douglas? I remember just feeling so uneasy and you decided to go in by yourself and I remember thinking how brave you were. I could talk to my creative writing teacher about things that I couldn't talk to you about because she understood everything. I mean she got shot. How do you think the shooting affected your ideas for the future? I didn't really think about that there was a possibility that I wouldn't grow up. You know, there was no possibility that maybe I might die at 15. But like once I saw some of my friends did it was just like I have a life. I wanted to do something to feel worthy. Seeing what you went through in this past year and seeing how you're sort of working through it even on the toughest, toughest nights. It's just so grateful. I'm just so grateful and proud of you. One night I got a phone call from my squadron commander and instead of using all the code words that we had rehearsed, he says, Jack, I got a real one for you. You don't often have two hydrogen bombs falling out of aircraft onto U.S. property. The weapon was three feet across in diameter and about nine feet long and it looked like a Washington monument right in the middle of a bunch of trees. What the status of the weapons were at that time was unknown so we were working in the dark. Once we determined it was safe to handle, we used the crane to tip it over and put it on the back of a flatbed truck. But the second bomb that parachute had not deployed and this huge multi-ton weapon penetrated at the ground at 700 miles an hour and buried itself in the swamp. You started digging you and your crew. How many men total did you have with you? Ten. We calm the terrible ten. I knew all of them very well. But nobody was cracking jokes like they usually did. And the first couple of days there, they didn't even have food for us, nothing. He was snowing, he was raining, he was frozen. That's why we worked in shifts, sometimes on our hands and knees. And as we started digging down, trying to find the second bomb, one of my sergeants says, Hey, Lieutenant, I found the arm safe switch. And I said, Great. He says, Non, not great. It's on arm. But we all knew what we were there for and the hazards that we were facing. So we pulled it up out of the mud and brought it up over this wooden rickety ladder that we had to the surface of the ground in a safe condition. The next morning, I got up and shawared and shaved and decided to sit down to write a letter to my folks. And by the time I'd written Dear Mom and Dad, my hand was shaking. I thought to myself, my God, where have I been? What have I been doing? You have to understand, had one or both of the weapons detonated, you would have created a bay of North Carolina, completely changing the configuration of the east coast of the United States. And the radiation could have been felt as far north as New York City. At the time, nobody knew it, but it could have easily been the start of another world war."
51,indianapolis.wav," Let's begin with the city of Indianapolis, the 16th largest city in the U.S. by both population and land area. My wife Sarah and I moved here in the summer of 2007. We drove a U-Haul with all our worldly belongings from the corner of 88th in Columbus and New York City to the corner of 86th and ditch road in Indianapolis, an incredibly stressful 16-hour drive. When we finally arrived in Indianapolis, we unpacked all our stuff and slept on an air mattress in our new home. The first place we'd ever owned, we were in our late 20s and we'd bought this house a few weeks earlier after spending maybe a half hour inside of it. The house had three bedrooms, two and a half baths, and a half finished basement, and our mortgage payment was a third of what our New York rent had been. I couldn't get over how quiet and dark the house was that first night. I kept telling Sarah that someone could be standing right outside our bedroom window and we wouldn't even know, and then Sarah would say, well, but probably not. And I'm just not the sort of person who is effectively comforted by probabilities, so several times through the night I got up from the air mattress and pressed my face against the glass of the bedroom window, expecting to see eyes staring back at me, but instead finding only darkness. The next morning I insisted we buy some curtains, but first we had to drop off that U-Haul. At the U-Haul return place, a guy handed us some paperwork to fill out and asked us where we were coming from. Sarah explained that we'd moved from New York for her job at the Indianapolis Museum of Art, and the guy said he'd bend the museum once as a kid. And then Sarah said, so what do you think of Indianapolis? And then the guy standing behind the counter at the U-Haul place paused for a moment and said, well, you gotta live somewhere. Indianapolis has tried on a lot of models and catchphrases over the years. Indianapolis is raising the game. You put the eye in Indy. Honest to goodness Indiana. But I'd propose a different model. Indianapolis, you gotta live somewhere. There's no getting around Indianapolis's many imperfections. We are situated on the white river, a non-navigable waterway, which is endlessly resonant as metaphor, but problematic as geography. Furthermore, that river is filthy because our aging water treatment system frequently overflows and dumps raw sewage directly into the river. The city sprawls in every direction, endless minimals and parking lots and non-descript office buildings. We don't invest enough in the arts or public transportation. One of our major thoroughfares is named Ditch Road for God's Six. Ditch Road, we could name it anything. Kurt Vonnegut Drive, CJ Walker Way, Rodi McRodeface. But we don't. We accept Ditch. Someone once told me that Indianapolis is among the nation's leading test markets for new restaurant chains because the city is so thoroughly average. Indeed, it ranks among the top so-called microcosm cities because Indianapolis is more averagely American than almost any other place. We are spectacular in our ordinaryness. The city's nicknames include Nap Town because it's boring and India no place. When we first moved here, I would often write in the mornings at my neighborhood Starbucks at the corner of 86th and Ditch. And I would marvel at the fact that all four corners of that intersection contained strip malls. It was all so horrifying to me. Even though I lived less than a half mile from that Starbucks, I had to drive because there were no sidewalks. All the land had been given over to cars, to sprawl, to the flat roofed soulessness of the American mini mall. I was disgusted by it, living in a tiny apartment in New York City where we could never quite eradicate the mice. I'd romanticized home ownership. But now that we actually had a house, I hated it. Indianapolis's favorite literary son, Kurt Vonnegut, wrote that one of the flaws in the human character is that everybody wants to build and nobody wants to do maintenance. Home ownership was all maintenance. There were always window treatments to install and door knobs to change. The water heater kept breaking. And most of all, there was the lawn. God, I hated mowing the lawn. My next door neighbor came over once while I was mowing and said, you know, when the Kaufman's lived here, this was the nicest lawn in the neighborhood. I hated that lawn. I hated that I wasn't good at mowing the lawn. And I hated that I wasn't like the Kaufmans. And I also hated the Kaufmans for being like they were. The lawn and the mini malls of 86th and ditch became the two poles of my resentment. I couldn't wait for Sarah to get a job somewhere else. Vonnegut once said, what people like about me is Indianapolis. He said that in Indianapolis, of course, to a crowd full of people from Indianapolis. But Kurt Vonnegut really did hold the city in high esteem. Toward the end of his life, he answered an interviewer's question by saying, I've wondered where home is. And I realized it's not Mars or someplace like that. It's Indianapolis when I was nine years old. I had a brother and a sister, a cat and a dog, and a mother and father and uncles and aunts. And there's no way I can get there again. Vonnegut's greatest novel, Slotter House 5, is about a man who becomes unstuck in time and how time conspires with consciousness. It's about war and trauma. But it's also about not being able to get back to before, before the fire bombing of Dresden, before his mother's suicide, before his sister's early death. I really do believe that Vonnegut loved Indianapolis. But it's telling that from the time he could choose to live somewhere, he did not choose to live here. Late in that first Indianapolis year, Sarah and I became friends with our neighbors, Marina and Chris Waters. Chris was a former Peace Corps volunteer and Marina was a human rights lawyer. And like us, they'd just gotten married. And like us, they were living in their first home. But unlike us, Chris and Marina really loved Indianapolis. We'd often go to lunch together at SMEES, a little family-owned restaurant in one of the 86th and ditch mini malls. And I would complain about the lawn care and the lack of sidewalks. And I remember once Chris said to me, you know, this is one of the most economically and racially diverse zip codes in the United States. And I said, what? And he said, it is, you can Google it. I did Google it. And he was right. The median home price near 86th and ditch is $200,000. But there are million dollar houses and $800 a month apartments. At that corner, there are Thai and Chinese and Greek and Mexican restaurants all independently owned. There's a bookstore, a fair trade gift shop, two pharmacies, a bank, a salvation army, and a liquor store named after the Constitutional Amendment that repealed prohibition. Sit outside of SMEES for an afternoon and you'll hear English and Spanish, Corinne and Burmese, Russian and Italian. The problem was never 86th and ditch, which turns out to be a great American intersection. The problem was me. And after Chris called my assumptions into question, I began to think differently about the city. I began to see it as a place where big moments in human lives take place. The climactic scenes in my two most recent novels, The Fault in Our Stars and Turtles all the way down both take place at the corner of 86th and ditch. And I think what people like about those books is Indianapolis. As with all the best sci-fi writers, Kurt Vonnegut was really good at seeing into the future. Way back in 1974, he wrote, what should young people do with their lives today? Many things, obviously. But the most daring thing is to create stable communities in which the terrible disease of loneliness can be cured. That seems to me an even more important and more daring endeavor than it was 40 years ago. And when people ask me why I live in Indianapolis when I could live anywhere, that's what I want to tell them. I am trying to create a stable community in which the terrible disease of loneliness can be cured. And you got to do that somewhere. When I am sick with the disease of loneliness, good weather and shimmering skyscrapers do me no good whatsoever, as a writer or as a person. I must be home to do the work I need to do. And yes, home is that house where you no longer live. Home is before and you live in after. But home is also what you are building and maintaining today. And I feel rather lucky in the end to be making my home just off of ditch road. I give Indianapolis four stars."
52,superheroesjustforeachother.wav," The first time I lifted her up and carried her away, I was acting on a whim, seeking an exit from a stupid but dangerous argument. Though we lived in the glittering center of Shanghai, we couldn't agree on where to go for dinner. Chinese or Italian? A high-rise restaurant with a commanding view, or the leafy garden of a French colonial mention. The stakes were hardly critical, yet our conflict was a proxy for a deeper question annoying at our life as a couple. Where were we headed? I grew exasperated. She said, forget dinner. In previous relationships, I might have stormed out and sought diversion in a bar, riding off the possibility of resolution as both futile and beneath my pride. This time though, I swept up Diana in my arms, damsel and distressed style. Caught by surprise, she succumbed to my rescue. I had literally elevated us above our stalemate. We kissed and headed out to dinner, no longer concerned about where we went. As a product of a 1970 style parenting that embraced therapy, I'd been marinated in the notion that talk was the sole means of alleviating human friction. Diana and I did plenty of talking. We could stay up all night and not run out of things to say, but the obstacles in our relationship were sufficiently waiting that words alone would not resolve them. I'm a dozen years older and was keen to start a family, but she wasn't ready. I was an ex-pad living in China, a foreign correspondent seeking to extend that life indefinitely. She was longing to get back to her family in New York and appalled by the thought of letting my career dictate her geography. She would be no one's appendage. Look in yield clarity, understanding and empathy, but sometimes it just brings exhaustion and recrimination. Sometimes action is the only pathway to goodwill, and when I picked her up, I proved it. When we met, Diana was about to move back to New York, but she didn't know where she would live or how she would support herself as she finished her first novel. I persuaded her to move in with me and stay in Shanghai. When she expressed discomfort with my high rise apartment, my bachelor pad, with a security guard's eyeed hers suspiciously, I found us another home. I felt a compulsion to surprise her, ease her worries, protect her, and demonstrate my devotion. I was intent on proving my worth to her. For the first time in my adult life, I had fallen so hard for a woman that she altered my values and updated my ways of thinking as if the world itself was new, all of which made me addicted to her approval. She still doubted that we had a future. And as each month seemed to reinforce the reality that we were hooked in deep. Now I had this go-to move. Every time she felt lost or worried, I swept her off her feet. Every time she contemplated walking away, I carried her over the next threshold. I aspired to be her superhero, rescuing her from whatever perils lay in our path. Two years into our relationship, I moved us back to New York. I threw myself into eradicating the mice from our Brooklyn apartment. I attacked the weeds in our modest backyard, wielding screwdrivers and pliers to keep the house in working order, and navigated pushy elbows at the farmer's market. At her wedding, on a steamy August evening, underneath the Manhattan bridge, I provoked gasps of delight from our friends and family as I carried my bride across the pebble beach and deposited her on the makeshift podium where we pronounced her a vows. Unimpeachable evidence that I had not only captured her, but earned her. When our son was born, I found myself, perhaps like most new fathers, feeling marginalized, but I could still wake up in the middle of the night and administer a bottle of pumped milk while Diana slept. I could assemble strollers, change diapers, and wrestle with car seats. But the next year, when our daughter arrived, my powers failed me. I was standing at the gate at the Gordier Airport about to board an early flight to Chicago for a reporting trip with my phone rang. Diana was an excruciating pain, home alone without 13-month old boy. She used the word contractions, but how could that be? It was early October. Our baby girl wasn't due until mid-January. Only two weeks earlier, we had gone in for the anatomy scan and everything was perfect. Let's wait 10 minutes, I told her, thinking the scare would surely pass. But 10 minutes later, I was sprinting out of the airport to a taxi line. In my cab got a flat on the highway and the driver shrugged, refusing to proceed. I heard myself threatening bodily harm as I forced him to continue to the next exit. There I managed to come in dear another cab and arrived at the hospital to find my wife doubled over in pain. Unsure where she was supposed to go. I braced her with my arms and letter into the delivery ward. And I was powerless to protect her from what came next. I held her hand while the doctors listened for the baby's heartbeat. I hunched by her sigh during the emergency C-section. We listened to the muffled sounds of the surgeon's exchanging words about a subject we could not comprehend. Was this a stillbirth? A miscarriage. What we learned provided neither clarity nor comfort. Our baby weighed less than two pounds. She had a one-third chance of dying and a one-third chance of surviving with severe developmental disabilities. As Diana lay in a recovery room bed, I was led upstairs to the neonatal intensive care unit where this whisp of a creature was encased in a glass incubator and connected to an alarming tangle of tubes, wires, and beeping machinery. It did not feel right to look at her, let alone photograph her as a nurse's urge me to do so I could share this image with Diana. She didn't look like a baby to me. There was nothing I could say or do to lift us from our stark reality. I tried to reassure Diana that there was at least a one-third chance that our daughter would be fine. But then the doctor returned to our hospital room to tell us that our daughter had suffered a brain hemorrhage. She used the word catastrophic and discussed the possibility of comfort care, a euphemism for pulling the plug. If the hemorrhage proved to be severe enough, we might have the option of detaching her from the machinery. Within an hour, she would die. I heard this as my cue to rescue my wife from our worst fears. Once the doctor had left, I told Diana that if comfort care became our daughter's fate, we would not be there to watch her die. We would go home to our irrepressible boy and pretend none of this happened. We would tell ourselves this was a miscarriage. Never having known her, we would not know the pain of losing her. I felt strengthened by my words of resolve, but my wife looked at me as if I had become a stranger. As if she were now facing this crisis alone. If it comes to that, she said, we would be there. We are her parents. However long she lives, whatever her life turns out to be, we are the ones who have to hold her. She is our baby. In that moment, I recognized that my wife was the real superhero. In trying to plot a clean escape, I was the coward. Over the months that followed, as our girl endured transfusions, a collapse long and countless terrifying procedures, fighting her way to a miraculous recovery and growing into the indomitable toddler she is today, my wife and I took turns rescuing each other. When one faltered, the other extended a hand. These days, we take deep pleasure in the simplest moments. We feel our daughter's sweet breath as we hold her and watch her splash her brother in the bathtub and we feel blessed. We know how close we came to losing her and to losing ourselves. I am no superhero. Neither is my wife, but we have a bond that somehow enables us to save each other from basic human weakness. This is its own kind of superpower."
53,howtodraw.wav," Where I grew up in the South, there was a right way to do things and a wrong way to do things. And the right way was to do what your family and society thought you should do. And the wrong way was to do something different. By age 30 I'd done most everything I was supposed to do. I'd overachieved in high school. I attended a prestigious college in the South. I had a good job and I'd married well within the child-bearing age. We'd married at my insistence, of course, but neither one of us was fully on board. So, except for moving up north to Boston, which caused my family to collectively take to their beds, I was on track with what we thought my life should look like, but I wouldn't happy, and I thought it was my career. And my family, I was expected to go into business. I'd been in public relations for seven years, but I didn't like the work anymore. I mean, I was good at it, but I was tired of working with clients, and plus I was working with companies like retail banking, traffic reporting, hazardous waste recycling, nothing that really blew my skirt up. So, I quit my full-time job and I started consulting, and I started taking classes to figure out what else I could do for a living. Now, the only criterion for the classes was that the instructors and students could not know or care what the financial times was. I took Needle Point, directing, and French. I found this brochure for the school of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. I thought, oh, well, this looks interesting. And I went to the school and I talked to the continuing education director, and I asked him which class he thought I should take. And he said, you need to take art as process. We take burnout executives in that class all the time. I sign up. It's my first day of art school. I do my best to look artsy to fit in. But even though I am not wearing pearls, they are still emblazoned on my chest. And our instructor wrote it introduces herself. And she says, there is no right way to make art, and there is no wrong way to make art. Now, this makes me extremely nervous, because I have been raised. There is a right way and a wrong way to do most everything. And then she says, the class will focus on process, the process of art making not the end result. Now, this makes me even more nervous, because I have been raised to focus on results, and not just any results, but the best results. And there are no grades. Things corine out of control. If there are no grades, how will I know if I'm over-achieving? I need to know that I'm over-achieving. We start with the basics. And in my entire life, I have never held a stick of charcoal in my hand, and it feels good. And I survived the first week of simple art exercises, and I enjoy myself. And the next week, Bob, one of the three instructors, says, today we're going to do gesture drawings, very fast drawings, about 45 second poses. And we're going to draw the energy and the movement and the essence of the figure. And I am thinking, what the heck is essence? And how the heck do you draw it? And a man, the artist's model, starts to undress. And I say, well, that's OK. You've seen a naked man before. You've even had sex with a naked man before. Your problem is, you don't know how to draw this naked man's essence. LAUGHTER And everybody else apparently does know how to draw his essence. As they're all busily getting out their easels, and knowingly getting out sheets of paper and charcoal, and other drawing mediums with which they excel. And I'm just standing there like the proverbial deer in headlights. And I begin to watch and imitate, because I am clueless, but competitive. LAUGHTER And so I ask Judy, who is standing next to me and also a mature student, I say, Judy, what are these supposed to look like? Because of course, I think there's only one right way to do this. And we're all going to draw the same image. And she looks at me bewildered and says, they're all going to look different. I'm paralyzed. What is mine supposed to look like? Can't I just do a slide presentation for your Board of Directors, maybe conduct a communications audit, assess your customer service capabilities? These are things I know how to do, things in which I excel. And I like to excel. And there is no way I'm going to excel drawing this naked man's essence. LAUGHTER And I'm about to cry. And then the competitive side of me kicks in and says, we'll just snap out of it, you bigwimp and do something. So I start making these hopeless dig figures every 45 seconds. Because that's how fast the poses are, every 45 seconds. And every 45 seconds, I feel like a total failure, which is a lot of times in one hour. LAUGHTER It's 80. LAUGHTER And the shame is enormous. And I'm mortified at how I'm anept I am. And I'm like beating myself up, forever trying anything different for even attempting anything new. And I'm in literal physical pain. I am so far out of my comfort level, I mean I actually hurt. LAUGHTER And I'm about to cry again. And that's when Bob comes over and shows me what amazing teachers can do. I don't even know what he says. All I know is he talks me off the ledge and breaks the vice grip that has a hold of me. And I start to draw. At the end of class, Bob picks one of my gesture drawings to put up on the wall with a bunch of other student drawings so we can discuss them. No one laughs at me or am I drawing. It actually holds its own. I have drawn a naked man. And I feel like I can do anything. But things at home start to get a little tricky. My husband is an art director. One of the reasons why I married him. I loved being with somebody artsy. He seemed so exotic and interesting. He was the creative one and I was the business one. But when I started going to art school, all the roles are off. The balance of power completely out of sync. So class continues for the next six weeks and it's an emotional roller coaster. I mean, my thinking is shifting and breaking apart and I cry every day. And my final assignment is a wall installation, which is a term I didn't know existed six weeks before. And it includes these three wall sculptures. These sculptures made out of the New York Times business sections and the Wall Street Journal all painted black. And they're bound in these really tight boxes. And each piece gets progressively more undone until the final piece explodes and Bob, the instructor that talked me off the ledge, sees it. And he says, Trisha, you know, you really ought to apply the museum school. Well, this thought had never occurred to me before. The back of my mind, I'm going to end up in business school. That this is the once in a lifetime event until I go back to my normal life. And I'm highly suspicious. And then it occurs to me what's happening. He's hitting on me. I have no artistic talent at all. He's just flattering me until he can get lucky. And this theory sticks until I find out he's been in a committed relationship for the past 18 years with his boyfriend. So then I start thinking of other reasons why they may want me to apply. Maybe they think I have a lot of money and I'll be a big donor because I was working at Harvard Business School at the time. Or maybe they think I know people who will be a big donors. And so while I'm using all of my creative energy, trying to imagine why I'm not creative, Charles, one of the instructors comes up to me and says, Trisha, you really ought to apply to the museum school. I mean, you know you're an artist. You're one of us. Panic begins to set in. And I am role in art school as a part-time student, but I'm still consulting. And I'm both excited and traumatized because for the first time in my life, I am not following the rules. And I say to my dear friend Sarah, who's also a sevener, I say, Sarah. I am so afraid of being different than everybody else. And she says, Oh Trisha, I'm so afraid of being just like everybody else. And my marriage begins to explode. And part of the reason is I'm not supposed to excel beyond men, definitely not beyond my husband, but I had places I wanted to go and he just wasn't moving fast enough. I kept pushing him to move faster so I could move forward. And one day he just says to me, Trisha, you just want me to go places. I don't want to go. At art school, since we don't have grades, we have review boards. And at the end of each semester, we put up all the work we've done and two instructors and several students review the work, give us feedback and guide us in our creative path. And I'm driving in my review board and the Jeep I've purchased for the yet to be conceived, children I assume I'll have. But instead, it's piled high with artwork. And at my review board, one of the students writes this on his review board sheet. You seem to be a little frantic. Very perceptive. It has something to do with control. It's okay to let go. You're expecting this to be black or white, but the process won't allow that. You've got to let go. I'm not sure if he's talking about my artwork or my marriage. My husband and I separate, and a dear friend of mine says, you know, Trisha, I love my husband, and I love my children, but I never thought I had options. You have options. And she's right because even though my life is blowing apart, or maybe because it is, I begin to really find my voice and step into my artwork. My mother sees it and says, why is it so dark? Why aren't there any heads? I'm scared. It's getting harder and harder to do my consulting work. And even though I'm getting paid a firehose cash, I know that if I do this work for much longer, I'm gonna die. Slowly, but I'm gonna die. And I realize I'm not just in the wrong job or the wrong marriage, I'm in the wrong life. I don't wanna do what other people want me to do or think I should do anymore. All I want is to make art. I'm an artist. And the week we separate, they tear down my family home of 25 years and my Jeep gets stolen. I have this keychain with three keys on it. One to the house I don't live in anymore. One to my family home that's been torn down and one to my Jeep that's been stolen. God is banging on my hood. So I tossed the keys, head to art school, and join my tribe."
54,thesurprisingthingilearnedsailingsoloaroundtheworld.wav," When you're a child, anything and everything is possible. The challenge so often is hanging onto that as we grow up. And as a four-year-old, I had the opportunity to sail for the first time. I will never forget the excitement as we closed the coast. I will never forget the feeling of adventure as I climbed onboard the boat and stared into her tiny cabin for the first time. But the most amazing feeling was the feeling of freedom, the feeling that I felt when we hoisted her sails. As a four-year-old child, it was the greatest sense of freedom that I could ever imagine. I made my mind up there and then that one day, somehow, I was going to sail around the world. So I did what I could in my life to get closer to that dream. Age 10, it was saving my schooled-in-a-money change. Every single day for eight years, I had mashed potato and baked beans, which cost four P each and gravy was free. Every day, I would pile up the change on the top of my money box. And when that pile reached a pound, I would drop it in and cross off one of the hundred squares I'd drawn on a piece of paper. Finally, I bought a tiny dinghy. I spent hours sitting on it in the garden, dreaming of my goal. I read every book I could on sailing. And then eventually, having been told by my school, I wasn't clever enough to be a vet. Left school age 17 to begin my apprenticeship in sailing. So imagine how it felt just four years later to be sitting in a boardroom in front of someone who I knew could make that dream come true. I felt like my life depended on that moment. And incredibly, he said yes. And I could barely contain my excitement as I sat in that first design meeting, designing a boat on which I was going to sail, solo non-stop around the world. From that first meeting to the finish line of the race, it was everything I'd ever imagined. Just like in my dreams, there were amazing parts and tough parts. We missed an iceberg by 20 feet. Nine times I climbed to the top of a 90 foot mast. We were blown on our side in the Southern Ocean, but the sun sets, the wildlife and their emoteness were absolutely breathtaking. After three months at sea, age just 24, I finished in second position. I loved it so much so that within six months, I decided to go around the world again, but this time, not into race, to try to be the fastest person ever to sail solo non-stop around the world. Now for this, I needed a different craft. Bigger, wider, faster, more powerful. Just to give that boat some scale, I could climb inside her mast all the way to the top. 75 foot long, 60 foot wide. I affectionately called her Moby. She was a multi-hole. When we built her, no one had ever made it solo non-stop around the world in one. Though many had tried, but whilst we built her, a Frenchman took about 25% bigger than her. And not only did he make it, but he took the record from 93 days, right down to 72. The bar was now much, much higher. And these boats were exciting to sail. This was a training sail off the French coast. This I know well because I was one of the five crew members on board. Five seconds is all it took from everything being fine to our world going black as the windows were thrust under water. And that five seconds goes quickly to see how far below those guys the sea is. Imagine that alone in the southern ocean plunged into icy water thousands of miles away from land. It was Christmas day. I was forging into the southern ocean underneath Australia. The conditions were horrendous. I was approaching a part in the ocean which was 2,000 miles away from the nearest town. The nearest land was Antarctica. And the nearest people would be those manning the European space station above me. You really are in the middle of nowhere. If you need help and you're still alive, it takes four days for a ship to get to you and then four days for that ship to get you back to port. No helicopter can reach you out there and no plane can land. We were forging ahead of a huge storm. Within it there was 18 knots of wind which was far too much wind for the boat and I to cope with. The waves were already 40 to 50 feet high and the spray from the breaking crests was blown horizontally like snow in a blizzard. If we didn't sail fast enough, we'd be engulfed by that storm and either capsized or smashed the pieces. We were quite literally hanging on for our lives and doing so on an eye-fedge. The speed I so desperately needed brought with it danger. We all know what it's like driving a car, 20 miles an hour, 30, 40. It's not too stressful. We can concentrate. We can turn on the radio. Take that to 50, 60, 70, accelerate through to 80, 90, 100 miles an hour. Now you have white knuckles and you're gripping the steering wheel. Now take that car off-road at night and remove the windscreen wipers, the windscreen, the headlights and the brakes. That's what it's like in the Southern Ocean. LAUGHTER You could imagine it would be quite difficult to sleep in that situation. Even as a passenger, but you're not a passenger, you're alone on a boat, you can barely stand up in and you have to make every single decision on board. I was absolutely exhausted physically and mentally. Eight sail changes in 12 hours. The mains will wait three times my body weight and after each change, I would collapse on the floor soaked with sweat with this freezing Southern Ocean air burning the back of my throat. But out there, those lowest of the lows are so often contrasted with the highest of the highs. A few days later, we came out of the back of the low. Against all odds, we'd been able to drive ahead of the record within that depression. The sky cleared, the rain stopped. And in a heartbeat, the monstrous seas around us were transformed into the most beautiful, moonlit mountains. It's hard to explain, but you enter a different mode when you head out there. Your boat is your entire world and what you take with you when you leave is all you have. If I said to you all now, go off into Vancouver and find everything that you will need for your survival for the next three months, that's quite a task. That's food, fuel, clothes, even toilet roll and toothpaste. That's what we do. And when we leave, we manage it down to the last stop of diesel and the last packet of food. No experience in my life could have given me a better understanding of the definition of the word finite. What we have out there is all we have. There is no more. And never in life had I ever translated that definition of finite that I felt on board to anything outside of sailing until I stepped off the boat at the finish line having broken that record. APPLAUSE Suddenly I connected the dots. Our global economy is no different. It's entirely dependent on finite materials. We only have ones in the history of humanity. And it was a bit like seeing something you weren't expecting under a stone and having two choices. I either put that stone to one side and learn more about it, or I put that stone back and I carried on with my dream job of sailing around the world. I chose the first. I put it to one side. And I began a new journey of learning speaking to chief executives, experts, scientists, economists to try and understand just how our global economy works. And my curiosity took me to some extraordinary places. This photo was taken in the burner of a coal fired power station. I was fascinated by coal, fundamental to our global energy needs, but also very close to my family. My great-grandfather was a coal miner and he spent 50 years of his life underground. This is a photo of him. And when you see that photo, you see someone from another era. No one wears trousers with a waistband quite that high in this day and age. But yet that's me with my great-grandfather. And by the way, they are not his real ears. We were close. I remember sitting on his knee, listening to his mining stories. He talked to the camaraderie underground and the fact that the miners used to save the crusts of their sandwiches to give to the poners they worked with underground. It was like it was yesterday. And on my journey of learning, I went to the World Coal Association website. And there in the middle of the homepage, it said, we have about 118 years of coal left. And I thought to myself, well, that's well outside my lifetime and a much greater figure than the predictions for oil. But I did the maths. And I realized that my great-grandfather had been born exactly 118 years before that year. And I sat on his knee till I was 11 years old. And I realized it's nothing in time, nor in history. And it made me make the decision I never thought I would make to leave the sport of solo sailing behind me and focus on the greatest challenge I'd ever come across, the future of our global economy. And I quickly realized it wasn't just about energy. It was also materials. In 2008, I picked up a scientific study looking at how many years we have of valuable materials were extract from the ground. Copper 61, tin, zinc 40, silver 29. These figures couldn't be exact, but we knew those materials were finite. We only have them once. And yet our speed that we've used these materials has increased rapidly, exponentially. With more people in the world with more stuff, we've effectively seen a hundred years of price declines in those basic commodities erased in just 10 years. And this affects all of us. It's brought huge volatility in prices so much so that in 2011, your average European car manufacturer saw a raw material price increase of 500 million euros, wiping away half their operating profits through something they have absolutely no control over. And the more I learned, the more I started to change my own life. I started traveling less, doing less, using less. It felt that actually doing less was what we had to do. But it sat uneasy with me. It didn't feel right. It felt like we were buying ourselves time. We were eking things out a bit longer. Even if everybody changed, it wouldn't solve the problem. It wouldn't fix the system. It was vital in the transition, but what fascinated me was in the transition to what? What could actually work? It struck me that the system itself, the framework within which we live, is fundamentally flawed. And I realized ultimately that our operating system, the way our economy functions, the way our economy has been built, is a system in itself. At sea, I had to understand complex systems. I had to take multiple inputs. I had to process them. And I had to understand the system to win. I had to make sense of it. And as I looked at our global economy, I realized it too is that system. But it's a system that effectively can't run in the long term. And I realized we'd been perfecting what's effectively an elinear economy for 150 years. Where we take a material out of the ground, we make something out of it, and then ultimately, that product gets thrown away. And yes, we do recycle some of it. But more an attempt to get out what we can at the end. Not by design. It's an economy that fundamentally can't run in the long term. And if we know that we have finite materials, why would we build an economy that would effectively use things up that would create waste? Life itself has existed for billions of years, and is continually adapted to use materials effectively. It's a complex system, but within it, there is no waste. Everything is metabolized. It's not a linear economy at all, but circular. And I felt like the child in the garden, for the first time on this new journey, I could see exactly where we were headed. If we could build an economy that would use things rather than use them up, we could build a future that really could work in the long term. I was excited. This was something to work towards. We knew exactly where we were headed. We just had to work out how to get there. And it was with exactly this in mind that we created the ElemacArthur Foundation in September 2010. Many schools of thought fed our thinking and pointed to this model. Industrial symbiosis, performance economy, sharing economy, bio mimicry, and of course cradle to cradle design. Materials would be defined as either technical or biological. Waste would be designed out entirely, and we'd have a system that could function absolutely in the long term. So what could this economy look like? Maybe we wouldn't buy light fittings, but we'd pay for the service of light and the manufacturers would recover the materials and change the light fittings when we had more efficient products. What if packaging was so non-toxic, it could dissolve in water, and we could ultimately drink it, it would never become waste? What if engines were remanufacturable, and we could recover the components materials and significantly reduce energy demands? What if we could recover components from circuit boards, reutilize them, and then fundamentally recover the materials within them through a second stage? What if we could collect food waste, human waste? What if we could turn that into fertilizer, heat, energy, ultimately reconnecting nutrient systems and rebuilding natural capital? And cars, what we want is to move around, we don't need to own the materials within them. Could cars become a service and provide us with mobility in the future? All of this sounds amazing, but these aren't just ideas they're real today, and these light the forefront of the circular economy, what lies before us, makes to expand them and scale them up. So how would you shift from linear to circular? Well, a team and I at the foundation thought you might want to work with the top universities in the world, with leading businesses within the world, with the biggest convening platforms in the world, and with governments. We thought you might want to work with the best analysts and ask them the question, can the circular economy decouple growth from resource constraints? Is the circular economy able to rebuild natural capital? Could the circular economy replace current chemical fertilizer use? Yes, was the answer to the decoupling, but also yes, we could replace current fertilizer use by a staggering 2.7 times. But what inspired me most about the circular economy was its ability to inspire young people. When young people see the economy through a circular lens, they see brand new opportunities on exactly the same horizon. They can use their creativity and knowledge to rebuild the entire system. And it's there for the taking right now, and the faster we do this, the better. So could we achieve this in their lifetimes? Is it actually possible? I believe yes. When you look at the lifetime of my great grandfather, anything's possible. When he was born, there are only 25 cars in the world that only just been invented. When he was 14, we flew for the first time in history. Now there are 100,000 charter flights every single day. When he was 45, we built the first computer. Many said it wouldn't catch on, but it did. And just 20 years later, we turned it into a microchip of which there'll be thousands of in this room here today. 10 years before he died, we built the first mobile phone. It wasn't that mobile to be fair, but now it really is. And as my great grandfather left us the internet arrived. Now we can do anything, but more importantly, now we have a plan. Thank you."
55,threemonths.wav," So when I was 26 years old, I watched my grandmother die. She had colon cancer and it was a fairly slow death. And at the time I was living in New York City and I had been doing comedy for many years. So I made it my goal that every day I went to visit her, I was going to make her laugh. And one day in particular I was visiting the hospital and she was off on some rant as my people tend to do. And she was talking about something super important like putting or whatever. And I said to her, listen old lady, you keep it up, I'm taking out, I'm going to wheel you out to the park and not leave you there. So she laughed because she had a very dark sense of humor which I love and probably well definitely inherited it. And she kept on with her rant. So I stuck her to wheelchair and I brought her out through the front door of the hospital across the parking lot to the far end of the parking lot. I faced her against brick wall, I locked her wheels and I left her there. And I just stood back about 20 feet and just watched her laugh, just belly laughing at the absurdity of him. And that night she was telling me that the few seconds or minutes during the day when she could laugh that it felt like everything was going to be okay, that she felt, she felt like in her words that she was being let out of jail. And so a little two-watt light bulb went off in my head and I said, hmm, and shortly after she passed away, I started an organization in New York City. And basically what we did is we brought comedians to perform for people who were homebound with AIDS or cancer in the last weeks and days of their lives. So we would bring three comedians. We had an actor playing a waiter and an actor playing a heckler and we would recreate a comedy club in people's living rooms. And it was a pretty amazing experience, especially for me at this age to get to spend time with people at the very end of their lives because what I saw in people was they were not scared anymore. And they were sort of open and had made peace, I think, with the fact that it was over. And so much so that they could allow joy into their lives. And that was a pretty amazing thing. And we were, we did probably 30 to 40 hours a week of these shows and then I had a 40-hour week job. And then on top of that, on top of that, my wife got pregnant at the time and it realizes that came out. It's not good. And so I was exhausted to say the least. I had never been this kind of tired before. And it was more than just, you know, you work 80 hours a week tired. It was like, the best way I could describe it is that it's sort of like my blood felt like it was electric. Like I could just run and run and run and run and never stop. But I couldn't get out of bed. And it was a really bizarre feeling. And so in the insistence of a friend, I went to go see a doctor. And this was a doctor who had become my friend through the organization. And we had done hundreds of shows for his patients. So he was now going to see me as a friend. And he ran all the blood work in the scans and poked and prided. And he called me a few days later at my apartment. And I picked up and he said, hey, Kito, why don't you come on down in my office and let's just talk about this stuff. And I said, okay. Not sure I said it like that. But I definitely agreed. And I took the subway up to his office. And when I walked in, I remember seeing the light box behind him with my films on him. And I had no idea what they meant. But as I turned my head and looked at him, I saw that he was crying. And it's not a great sign when your doctor is crying. I sort of feel like if you're on a flight and it's super turbulent and the pilot runs out crying from the cockpit. That's how it felt. And so he told me that I had a very aggressive form of cancer that was in its late final stages. And if he had to put a timeframe on it, he would say I had roughly three months. So now I was 28 years old. My wife was eight and a half months pregnant. And I was looking at three months. I don't really remember getting home that day. I remember being on the subway and it being very blurry. And I remember this mantra that I kept repeating, don't tell Jen, don't tell Jen, don't tell Jen. Jen was my wife and her mother had been diagnosed with cancer and given a three month prognosis and died three months later. So her only framework for this disease was you get an expiration date, you hit the expiration date and that's it. So I decided I wasn't going to tell her. So when I walked into the apartment, she was cooking and she turned to me and her belly turned to me and she said, how did it go? And I said, fine, everything's good. I couldn't keep the secret to myself. So I decided I was going to tell my father. So I took the train to Boston and we went for a walk and it was so quiet. All I could hear was just the crunching of our feet on the snow. And at a certain point I turned to him and I told him, and I'll never forget to look on his face because he had these beautiful green eyes that suddenly just went black. And his eyes got wide and I could see my reflection in his eyes and he started crying and I'd never see my father cry and I started crying. And he just held me like, oh, is it years old again? And we stood there. That night I went to bed and the upstairs of his house and I heard him come up the stairs and I heard him go into his room and I heard him crying and I heard him talking. But I knew he was alone. I also knew he was a devout atheist so that prayer was not probably something he was doing. But I found out the next morning that he had in fact prayed and he had asked God to take away my cancer and give it to him. Seven days later I got a call at my apartment. I was back in Manhattan and he was in Boston and he was crying. And he had news of his own. The abdominal pain that he had felt that he'd been dealing with for the last eight months, the doctors had been treating as heartburn. It turned out to be pancreatic cancer. And the doctors couldn't tell him how long he had other than the fact that he could not survive this cancer. So he started treatment in Boston and I started in New York. And my very first day of chemo, I went to the hospital by myself and I sat in the infusion chair and they started the IV and they started the poison into my blood and I just cried because I was so scared, scared shit list of what was coming. And as the day was winding down I got a call on my cell phone and I looked down and it was my wife and I picked up the phone and she said it's time. So now she was in labor. And I got in a cab and I went home as quickly as I could and I walked in the door and she looked like she was in so much pain. She was timing the contractions and I grabbed her hand and I grabbed the bag that we were told to prepare weeks before and we went to the hospital and it didn't take long once we got there. This child was determined to be out into this world and I was grateful because I knew how little time I had. And I will never forget the look, just the visual of his head emerging and his shoulders coming out and that moment when I'm holding him and I thought, oh my God, I have the sun and he is never going to know his father and I will probably lose mine as well. And I just held him there and I just kissed him a million times on the forehead. So I love this little boy so much and I just kept kissing him and kissing him and I wanted to swallow him up and protect him from everything. I eventually told my wife and she didn't talk to me for a few days. She eventually forgave me and told me she loved me and felt that I did the right thing and that she wouldn't change anything and she thanked me. I went to Boston to spend time with my dad and we were both sort of in a race to the finish line at this point. And it was a pretty amazing thing because as we laid in bed together, I thought about the patients that I had worked with and I thought that I genuinely can say that I made peace with the fact that I was dying and I know he had made peace with the fact that he was dying. But I know that neither of us had made peace with the fact that each other was dying. And about two weeks later, we took him to the hospital because he had what was going to be a fairly routine bowel obstruction surgery. And I knew when we were driving that I was never going to see him again. And that last day, that last night when I held him and I just kept kissing his forehead and then he was gone. We were at his funeral and I looked across the grave and I saw my wife and my son there. And I thought the next funeral they're going to be at is mine. And I got a call on my cell phone and I let it go to voicemail. And after the funeral was over, I walked up to a hill in the cemetery and I listened to the voicemail and it was my doctor telling me that based on the recent scan, the most recent scan, it appeared that my cancer was now in remission. And it was, it was gone for now. But it wasn't for long and I have struggled with it ever since. But I think about that little boy whose head I saw emerge into the world. And just two months ago, that kid started his freshman year in high school. And the other night when I was putting him to bed, I was telling him how much I loved him and I loved who he is. He's a very shy, introverted kid with his huge heart and he's so sweet. And I was just telling him how much I love him and I said to him, you know, buddy, some day you are going to be a great father and he kind of mumbled and gave me this devious little smile and said, you know what, Dad, one day you're going to be a great father too. Thank you so much."
56,lifeanddeathontheoregontrail.wav," Hello. So it's the last unit of the year. I'm teaching third grade, and the last unit is the Oregon Trail. And I am prepared to have my students really live the Oregon Trail. This is how I taught third grade. I would create a world and then run it like a puppet master. I, and a lot of those times those worlds were goofy. Like we would have always a game. We got letters from a stuffed animal rock band named Antikleia and the Howlers who were lost across the United States and we were studying geography. So to help them, we had to study the states. We got letters from time machines. My characters had names like Cheesy DePizza and Caesar von Salad. I was not a serious teacher. But now this is the Oregon Trail. This is a serious time. And this is also a really complicated time in American history. But to be totally honest, I'm not sure I can get at the like historical and moral complexities of westward expansion with nine year olds. They have trouble taking the perspective of their little sister. So I'm not really sure I can do that. But I know I can get at the gravity of it, right? This is pioneers 2,000 miles across the United States, which weren't the United States yet, across the Rockies, leaving everything they know, risking everything they have, blizzards and hunger and all these things. So at least I can get, it's really real. And at least I can get my kids to feel like it's really real. So I come to my class and I say we're going to be doing the Oregon Trail. And this one smart ally kid named Alex says, well, will it be a game? Because he knows it's always a game. And I say, yeah, but it's going to be a dangerous game. And they're pretty psyched about that. So what I've planned is like a simulation. We're going to take on characters of pioneers and we're going to travel the Oregon Trail on a wagon train. So first we have to choose names for our characters. I download and print the names of real people who died on the Oregon Trail. It's preauthentic. And so they can have their first names, but they have to have last names like Chapman and Blonderfield and Alex is now Alex Bacon. And then they have to choose occupations. And all the girls want to be pop stars. And I tell them there were no pop stars on the Oregon Trail. There's authentic occupations from the 1840s. So okay, so great. There are farmers and there are gold miners and there's a couple of doctors and we're good. But before we start, I want them to feel what it really felt like to walk for that long. So I was here in Manhattan. I took them on a 40 block walk. It's about two miles. It's not that long. It's long if you're a nine year old, I guess. And it's a beautiful day. We're going up the west side. We're going up the Hudson. And Alex Bacon says to me, well, I wouldn't have had to walk. I would have ridden in the wagon. And I said, no, no. Children never rode in the wagons. The wagons were for if there were someone sick or our supplies or if we had a piano because I have done my research. And then another kid says, well, I'm thirsty. And I say, well, there were no water fountains on the Oregon Trail. And he says, well, there's a water fountain right there. I think about the parent phone call I do not want to get about withholding water from a child. And I think fast. And I say, ah, a stream. How fortunate. Let us partake. And so we finally get back. And we're hot and sweaty, but we're ready. We're ready to go on our journey. And the way I've designed it is, previously, all of my games were just fiction. Like I would just write a letter. And then they would respond. And I would write another letter that night. I always knew what was going to happen. But now I want to play a little more dangerously because it was all luck what happened on the Oregon Trail, right? So I have designed a game of chance. I have combined, do you guys know the Oregon Trail video game? Fans, OK? I've designed, I've combined the Oregon Trail video game with principles of dungeons and dragons, the role-playing game with dice. So what we're going to do is every day, I'm going to tell them what happened on the trail that day. And I'm going to make some choices about what they want to do. And then we're going to roll dice to see if they succeeded or failed. So I'll give you an example. We get to a river and they have to decide, do they want to pay a fairy man or do they want to ford their wagons? And they decide to ford their wagons. We roll to find out if their wagon's sink are floated. That kind of thing. So it's easy. Great. All right. So the first day starts. And I have this bonnet that I've sewn out of old upholstery material. And I put on this bonnet and I tell them, I am Mary, your wagon train captain. We are all here for different reasons, but we will have to work together to get through the bad weather and the hunger and the wild animals that await us. And Alex Bacon says, excuse me, Mary, this is a dangerous game. Kooie die. And I was a little in character at that point. And I will also admit I wanted to take Alex down a peg. So I said, sure, people died on the Oregon Trail all the time. Someone might die. And this shiver of excitement goes across my class. They like to my stuffed animal rock band, but they are into danger. And I know I'm not going to let anyone die. Like I'm not going to let it get there, right? No one's going to die on the Oregon Trail. But the idea that someone might get them wanting to come to social studies every day. So this is OK. So we're off. We're tracking our mileage. And we're rolling dice. And we're making tough choices. And at some point, I have them meet a snake oil salesman who offers to sell them in a liquor that will make them stronger and faster and get to Oregon City quicker. And something you need to know about nine-year-olds, a lot of them, pretty much all of them, don't know what snake oil salesmen are. I say this to you, and you know, this is shorthand for a con man, right? But to them, it's just someone else they don't know about. Like taxes. It's just a thing. I got a grown-up thing. OK, snake oil salesman. So they decide to buy the elixir because they want to get there faster. So we roll to see how much stronger and faster they got. And of course, we all know the answer is none faster. It's snake oil. So I tell them, actually, that was a con. You are throwing up for a day. You lose a day of travel. And I think they're going to be really annoyed that they got slowed down. But they are psyched. They got to throw up in social studies. They're talking about it for days. My game is a hit. The problem is, every day before we start, someone says to me, is someone going to die today? Is someone going to die today? And I've been putting them off and putting them off. But my game is going so well. And we're getting towards the Rockies. And I figure, you know what, I'm going to give them just a brush with death. So I write out a bunch of possibilities for that day. And the next time someone asks me, is someone going to die today? I say, we have been lucky thus far. But the Rockies lie ahead. The most treacherous part of our journey. Who knows what might happen? So I put on the bonnet. That's what I did. I loved that action. And I set the scene for the morning. In the early morning light on a Rocky Mountain pass, a wagon hits a rock and is overturned. Someone has trapped beneath the wagon. Let us roll to find out who it is. I'm not proud of this. I take off the bonnet. And we have like a system of roles to figure out different kids have different numbers. And I roll. And it's this little girl, Katie. I know. Her Oregon trail name is Catherine Chubbick. She's a farmer. She's one of these kids who always has really messy hair and sounds like she's been smoking since she was three. And she has to come to the front of the class. And I say, Catherine Chubbick, your legs have been trapped beneath the wagon. Roll to find out if you get free and what happens. And she rolls. And she gets free, but her legs have been infected. I wrote these possibilities. And this is the first time I'm thinking, why did I write that possibility? This is getting really dark. And I say, Catherine Chubbick, roll to find out if your infection gets better or worse. And she rolls. And it gets worse. And she looks at me and just goes, did I die? And as soon as she says it, I realize how much trouble I am in. I haven't written any more possibilities. I didn't think we would get this far. So what happens next? Do we have a funeral on the side of the Oregon Trail for Catherine Chubbick? Is that the parent phone call that I get for having traumatized a girl for killing her on the Oregon Trail? Dead teachers kill kids on the Oregon Trail. And I am not a bad teacher or so I thought, this is all the stuff that's happening in my head. I'm thinking so much about it. A lot of it is very existential. And then all of a sudden, from the back of the class, this little girl Ellis, whose Oregon Trail name is Dr. Ellis Chapman, just goes, wait, I'm a doctor! And I'm like, thanks. The Lord! Dr. Chapman brings her doctor back. She knows how to heal the wood. Ellis Chapman comes up to the front of the room. I say the only way you roll to find out what happens, the only way you die is if you roll a six. That's the only way you die. The class is holding their breath. As Katie rolls, she does the lucky, like, shake thing and then someone just goes, shake them again. She shakes and she rolls. And it's a three. And she survives. I know. I know. In my class, it's like the end of Apollo 13. Kids are throwing papers in the air. I like hugging each other. And Ellis is hugging Katie and Katie's just going, I almost die. I almost die. And I'm so glad we agreed to bring a doctor on the Oregon Trail with us. She couldn't hunt, but she was very useful. And the problem is, so that was great. The problem is, we still have 720 miles to Oregon City. And I'm exhausted. I can't remember a time before we were walking the Oregon Trail. And the next day, you know, I had all this stuff planned. The next day, I get to class. I put my bonnet on. I tell them, we hear animal noises in the bushes. And Alex Bacon is right on it. He goes, is it wild animals? Are we in danger? And he says it. And I realize they love the danger. I'm the one who doesn't want the danger. And I throw my plan out the window. It was wild animals, and we were in danger, actually. But I forget about that. I say, no, it is a baby animal with a broken leg who we must adopt for the rest of the trip. And they all do the third grade baby animal noise, which is, oh. And I say, let us roll to find out what species of baby animal we will be adopting. Is it a baby bunny, a baby fox, or a baby wolf? It's a baby wolf. They name him Yenny the Benny. They love him very much. And he follows us all the way to Oregon. And we get to Oregon in record time. I mean, forget Pioneer's Walking. This is Amazon Prime 2-day shipping to get to Oregon City. Nothing bad happens between the Rockies and Oregon City. And when we get there, we do, we homestead, and we do our budgets. And we do all that stuff. But we also make cornbread. And we have a dance party to September by Earth Wind and Fire. Which is not historically accurate. But that is the kind of Oregon Trail I want to be on at that point. So that's the Oregon Trail. But I have to tell you guys about a year ago, I ran into Katie on the street on Broadway. And she's in ninth grade now. She looks exactly the same except that she's been stretched, you know? And I recognized her right away. And she recognized me and we hugged. And I said, how are you? And she said, and the first thing she said to me was, do you remember when I almost died on the Oregon Trail? And I said, yeah, Katie, I absolutely remember. Thank you."
57,breakingupintheageofgoogle.wav," In August of 2001, me and my boyfriend of six years, my first love in my life, went through one of the worst breakups in the history of recorded man. And I know that may sound naive or self-absorbed, and that's because it is. But I swear, I was really, really bad. We worked together at the same company, but that's not where we met. We met in college when we were both like 18, 19 years old. And when we met, I was this super, super nerdy virgin. And it was hard to imagine, but I was really a nerd and I was really a virgin. And he was sort of this chubby, like, almost virgin. You know what I mean? He had a really fat face. And he had slept with someone, but it was like he was really should've been, like he maybe stuck it into someone like an inch. You know what I mean? But for one time, the purpose is, anyway, so we both had really low self-esteem. And that was sort of part of what brought us together. You know, it was like, I feel a little clobby about myself. So do I. Do you want to come over him? That's ex? So that was like part of the thing. But then the magical thing with that happen was we got in this relationship. We loved each other and we shower each other with affection and sex and love. And over time, we started to feel better about ourselves. You know, so like at the end of the six years, we were both feeling okay and we were both sort of secretly, independently wondering what would be like to sort of like give having sex with someone else a go. You know what I mean? And that's when the relationship began to crumble. And even though we still loved each other, we ended up breaking up and he asked me to move out of our shared house. And I was devastated. But it was sort of devastated where you think you feel bad, but something's going to happen. It's going to make you feel worse. And for me, that was finding out that like three weeks after I moved out, he started sleeping with this 22 year old blonde assistant at the same company we worked at. She sat like five feet away from me. Yeah. Well, fuck her, right? She, I was, I have a normally a level head who I'm being. I went fucking Apesha. I went berserker. I didn't know how to handle this. It was the worst thing that ever happened to me in my life. Like, it was a month, part of six years is the worst thing. And the, well, maybe even worse, she was, she was absolutely like a Jewish girl like worse chicks and nightmares. You know what I mean? She was like blonde. She was petite. She was way featured at pertinose and like no visible body hair. It was just like the worst thing. So I said, Jew, I hated her for being everything that I wasn't. But then the worst fucking thing was that someone who was in the know told me that she was also a Jew. And I was like, oh my god. I was like, how could like, remember my own tribe betray me this way? And the worst thing was that now like there was like the potential for her to actually be like neurotic and interesting. You know what I mean? And I couldn't just imagine her as this sort of like emotionless wasp, you know, which is what I've been thinking to make myself feel better. And I know that it's like wrong to ask them to stereotype people, but I feel like if you already hate them for really valid reasons already, it's okay. It's all right, right? So I was having a break down, just a total breakdown. But I was like, okay, I'm a normal human being. I will take the routes people can take to recover from this in the normal amount of time. So I tried to go into therapy to talk it out. Didn't work. I tried going to the gym to work it out. That didn't work. Instead, I fell into this depressive fucking spiral where I couldn't think about anything. I was just ruled by these two horrible urges. One was the urge to just sort of massacistically think about how much prettier she was than me. And everything about her that was, I don't know, just so much more perfect and sexier and better. The other urge was that I needed to find out anything, something about her, something about her personality that would allow me to hate her. They were allowing to feel superior to her, like some like bit of dirt on her that would prove she was actually shitty. That wasn't what I planned to say, but it's really what was here. So one day, I'm winding on the phone to my friend Wendy. God bless Wendy. And I'm like, hey, I want to hate her. I want to hate her. What can I find out to make her hateable? And she was like, wow, have you tried googling her? Now, I was a nerd, but I was not a geek. So I didn't know what Google was. I didn't know, and I'm sure, right, you all know what it is. If there's one or two people here, I'll explain it. Google is the most powerful thing ever invented on the planet. It is this fucking insane search engine that allows you to be crazy and stalk someone from the comfort of your own fucking home. Right? It is a more important invention than fire or the wheel, as far as I'm concerned. So she was like, why don't you Google her? And I was like, yeah, I'm going to Google the crap out of this curl. Because I knew her name. So I went to the little search window and I entered name. I won't say her name here, but needless to say, it was Slitzgang. So I googled her and I didn't understand the power of Google. So I wasn't really expecting anything to happen, but within three seconds, this link comes up. And it takes me to this article that had been an interview with her from her college newspaper freshman year. And it was like this thing where she was like the canvas celebrity of the day. And I was like, that's retarded. So hopefully that would prove that she too was retarded, but that's not what fucking happened. Listen to this. So the thing comes up. There's a photo of her and it's the most adorable photo of a human being ever taken. She couldn't look blonder or more waspy Jewish. She's like wearing low-riders sweatpants before anyone even knew about those. And like a thing with a cow on it and she's just in the three quarters. Great. Oh, and that drove me nuts. And I was scared to move on to the article, but I did. It was an interview. And in the interview, she revealed that her greatest desire, goal in life was to become a stand-up comic, a famous stand-up comic. And I was like, fuck me. Because that was my secret goal. That was my goal. And I'd always wanted to do that since I was a kid, but I never had the guts. I'd never had the moxie to do it. And here it was. I was reading. She was already in a sketch group. Oh my god. I was like, so okay. So she looks waspy, but she's Jewish. She's banging my boyfriend. And she's already like a pearly, honor-weighted achieving my dream. This cannot stand. And I decided if we were both like aiming for the moon, right? We both had the same goal. This is going to be a fucking space race, right? And if it kills me, I'm going to be John fucking Glenn. I'm getting there first, right? So I start to perform. So I run a thing. I've never been more miserable in my life. And I start trying to write jokes and go perform. I'm going to open mics and it's depressing. And I hate it. But over time, it's like slowly improving. I get to do book shows. So it goes to my two or three depressing open mics. A four or five, like, okay, show's a week. But all along, I'm still just like, manically depressed, right? And I'm like googling her endlessly. And looking at the picture. And that picture became the focal point. Not only of my loathing for her, but my loathing for myself. And I literally, like, five or six times a day, would just stare at the photo. And I felt terrible in myself. And my therapist was like, if you don't stop googling her, I'm going to call your doctor and put you on Prozac. And I didn't want to go on Prozac, because I was scared of one side effects of Prozac would be that I'd become less witty. And being witty was sort of the only side effect of being depressed that was working for me. You know what I mean? So. Really should not clap. But so I was like, fuck. So I decided to keep performing. And I'm not going to go on Prozac yet. So I'm performing. So one day, I'm doing this show. It's like a slightly better place than I usually do it. And I'm watching the audience stream and, you know, filling in as before the show starts. And who walks in but her? She comes in. The show had been advertised in time out in New York. My name, it was very clear. She must have known I was going to be there. I was like, what fucking kind of weird drive-by shit is this? Because she sat in the front fucking row. It was clear. And I was like, oh my god, I felt so terrible. I was looking at her. She was pretty. I barely could go on. It just so upset me. I managed to do it. And I ran out as soon as I was done. I ran home. Because I needed to have my nightly loath fest with the photo. Right? And I'm sitting there. I was just like, how could you do it? I'm about to Google her. And all of a sudden it occurs to me. Maybe the reason she came there is because she's also obsessed with me. Like, I am the girl before. She's staying in this guy. I was in for six years. So she must be curious. She must be driving her crazy. And I was like, what if she's Googling me? And I don't know why it had never occurred to me to try googling myself. I think I thought there was a rule against it or something. Or that the computer would like implode. Like, the self-absorption wouldn't be handled. But I was like, I'm going to do it. I tie my name in. I Google myself. And to my shock and amazement, there's like shit there. On the computer about me. I didn't put it there. And it's all stuff about performing. It's all like links to advertisements for shows I had done. So there's still there. One or two, I kind of just really brief like nice mentions about things. And it just sort of briefly made me feel better. Because it was like, okay, if this is the space race, maybe fucking little sputnik bitch is not like as far ahead of me as I thought. But whatever. Okay, so I just like, take a breath. But it did so it made me feel better. And like, I realized that it was the only antidote to like the shitty feelings I have when I would Google her was to Google myself. And that's how I became obsessed with googling myself. And here's the thing about googling yourself. It's as dirty as it sounds. You know what I mean? It is master, it just is masterbating. There's no like, you have this urge to do it, but you don't want anyone to know you're doing it. But the thing is just like masterbating people deny it, but everyone does it. You know what I mean? But I would Google myself. I would look at things. I would see if anything new was coming up. Blah blah blah. So anyway, I couldn't stop. I was googling her and googling myself. Gugling her and googling myself. Feeling bad, feeling good. Okay. So one day I do a show at Irving Plaza. I was like this big thing. Do the show. I would say, I would like to have a day, you know, normal stuff. Come home, Google myself. Want to check in. Want to check in. And something new pops up and it's this thing. The heading. It's this link. It's this funny girl. And I click on it and it takes me to Craigslist. Yes? Do we know what Craigslist is? If anyone here doesn't know, it's just like hippie-dippy bultin board. People renting apartments and giving each other bikes and shit. And, but there's this thing on it called misconnections. And that's what funny girl was from. And misconnections is like that, you know, on the back of the voice, like, when people see each other on the street, and you're running out of time, you see someone cuter or whatever, and you don't have to guess a talk to them. And then the next day you write something, it's like, hey, I saw you on 6th Avenue in 8th Street. You were running a Metallica t-shirt. I like Metallica. Oh, please call me. You know, like that. And it's like billions of them. And that's what funny girl was. Someone wrote, it's seen me at the living place where I was like, funny girl, like, hey, Jessie Kine. I saw you at the show and I thought you're really adorable. I wanted to talk to you afterwards, but I didn't have the guts, you can email me. This is the most amazing thing that's ever happened to me my entire life. I've never had someone just sort of like me without putting a lot of work into it. Like, when I used to want to hook up with guys, it was like a huge exertion of personality, which was exhausting. It's exhausting to have a personality. Like, I'd much, oh, fuck, fuck me. So, okay, so, so, so, okay, so I was like, oh my god, that's amazing. So, ah, damn you and your violin. Curses. Okay, so that was this like incredible thing. And I was overjoyed. And I touched my friend Nick about it. I was like, Nick, should I email this guy? And he was like, Jessie, he looked at the date. He's like, wasn't that post of the day if you did that show or you did the joke about how I like to put guys balls in your mouth? And I was like, what's your point? What is your point? He likes me. He really likes me. Anyway, so there was like, take a couple days to think about it, right? In the space of those few days, I continued to go to myself more shit, start popping up on Craigslist about me. The second thing was this from a totally different guy. And he's like, I saw you performing, but this one was kind of creepy. It wasn't as brief and adorable. It was like, ooh. And that's when I was like, yeah, maybe the people on Craigslist's misconceptions are not dating material, but it could sort of be funny material for the stage. Because it's really the greatest website ever. So, I started doing this bit all around town about Craigslist and misconnections. And I found out that when I did it by saying it, I was like inviting every like delinquent loon to my little app because they would, people would email shit to me because they knew I looked at it. And stuff kept popping up and popping up. What I didn't immediately know was that a lot of it was from my fucking friends. Because once I told them about the first two, they were like, ha ha, wouldn't it be funny to like, fake her out. So it was like these decoys, but I didn't care. Because if you looked on Craigslist, it looked like I was hot shit for like a week. I was like, awesome. I was such hot shit. I'm almost, please don't play it again. So, you're very good. But one day, I come, it's like within this like special two weeks, I get back to my office from lunch and I have a voicemail on my phone from a man who identifies himself as a writer for the fucking New Yorker. And he says, hello, he's like, I've seen all this stuff about you on Craigslist. I would like to write a talk of the town piece about you and like this crazy trend. Please call me. Oh my god. What better revenge on the ex-boyfriend and on the sluts gang than for them to read an article in the New Yorker about the fact that I am hot and I am funny and I have fucking groupies. Oh my god. Oh my fucking god. And I was like, I did it. I called him. It was done to you. I was like, bitch, I made it to the moon first. How's the fucking feel down there, bitch? With no one writing about you in the New Yorker, the most legitimate publication ever, right? I've won. I've won. I'm on the moon. But then something happened. Which was that the article didn't happen. Oh. She loves the pity. No, it didn't happen. Two days later, I don't even remember why it didn't happen. I'm really three more seconds. I don't know why it didn't happen. He was very nice on the phone. He called me and pitched it to his editor for some reason he couldn't get it through. I was really nice on the phone back. I was like, that's okay. Don't worry. Okay, fine. Hang up. I was more disappointed than I'd ever been in my life. And I started bawling. Bawling. Having a breakdown. Bawling crying. And during that bawl the haste, I had this like a piphany where I left my body. It's like my soul sometimes like I can't take it. I left my body. I floated up to the top of the office. I looked down. I was like, let's take a lay of the land here. I'm in my office where I've not done any work for my employer in about six months. I've been diddling myself on the internet constantly. And I'm crying. I'm crying. And I'm disappointed about why? Not because I didn't get the article in the New Yorker, but because the ex boyfriend and the skank wouldn't read it. That's fucked up. Right? And it was sort of like at that second, it all just sort of like dawned on me that in the years since the breakup I'd become so obsessed with being in this race to make other people laugh. That I'd lost my ability to laugh at myself. And I was like, if I could just regain the ability to step back and look at all the crazy things I've been doing since this thing happened, I would be a better comic. Like this would be material. This is much funnier than anything I've been trying to write. And moreover, I would be a happier person. So that's what I did. And I've become a better comic. And I've become a happier person. And the other thing I decided was I really need to try to get laid. I'm desperate. And I try to do that. And after a year kind of work, and I've been dating this guy that I really like. And I don't look at that girl's picture anymore, but he and I Google each other constantly. Thank you very much."
58,adventuresinsayingyes.wav," I first started taking care of other people's children when I was actually still just a child myself. So that meant people were paying me basically to play and that was really awesome. But it also meant that I was getting a ton of childcare experience and that by the time I was 16, I probably could make macaroni and cheese with my eyes shut or change a diaper with one hand tied behind my back, which I only probably ever would have to do with those very naughty Nicholson boys. But their mother knew they were a handful. She was paying $10 an hour in 1988. So I kind of thought that all of my childcare experience was gonna teach me everything that I needed to know about parenting my own children. And my husband and I, we had a daughter and then a son. And then we decided to become foster parents with the intention of hopefully being able to adopt one day. And you know how everybody always says, you need a license to drive a car, but you don't need one to have a child. That's not true when you become a foster parent. We did have to get a license. And so first we had to take these classes where they asked us really hard hitting questions. Like, is second hand smoke good or bad? And do babies actually need car seats? And then we had to do all sorts of other things. Have physicals done background checks, fingerprinted, have her home inspected interviews. I mean, the whole thing turned out to be way more complicated than just creating a new human being with my body. And then there were all the questions. What kind of child would we be willing to take? A girl or a boy? What race? What age? Now I grew up with three sisters and I already had one boy that I didn't always know how to relate to, but then I heard that boys are actually left behind more in adoption requests. So we said that we preferred a boy, any race, and having survived to infants already, we thought that that pleasure could be afforded to someone else. So anything up to age four, the age of our biological son at the time. And we got our license in the mail and we settled in for what we thought could be a very long wait. But we got a phone call six weeks later about a baby at the hospital. And I thought, wow, an infant. Doesn't everybody else want an infant? But we said yes. And when we went to the hospital to pick him up, the nurses insisted on pushing me out to the car in a wheelchair. Which I thought was very funny. I mean, I didn't suffer any physical distress bringing this kid into the world. And even though I thought it was really funny, though, I realized I was having the same exact, overwhelmingly surreal sensation that I had when I first left the hospital with my first two babies. And that was there's a new person here. There's this new human being that's so tiny and perfect and amazing. And this hospital staff is going to let us just leave with him even though they look really competent. And we got him home and it became obvious right away that there were things that we still needed to learn in spite of years of baby seating and parenting experience and having a license to parent. Like what to do when a young woman comes bouncing up to you and says, your baby is so cute. Is his daddy black? So I just pretended I couldn't really remember. Or what to do when a woman taps you on the shoulder at a crowded restaurant and demands to know where's that baby from? And when told New Jersey, just continues to keep asking, but where before that? But where before that? Until you're finally just forced to say a uterus. Or what to do when you're four-year-old white son comes running up and says, we're playing circus. And the baby has to be the monkey because he's brown. And your African-American caseworker is visiting and all you can think to do is that you just want to die on the spot. And so instead you just pretend you didn't hear him and make a strong mental note to talk to him about that later. I don't think they told us anything about transracial adoption in those classes. The most they might have said was something along the lines of, if you are white and have a black child placed with you, please, for the love of God, get some help with their skin and hair. And so I turned to my black friends and I asked for help. And they helped me. And they also taught me things like that. My little black boy was only going to be cute in the eyes of the public for a certain age. And then he would somehow overnight be perceived as threatening to the public and that it was going to happen much sooner than I would anticipate. And I listened to them and I learned from them, but I didn't experience any of that harsh reality yet. And our case moved along and we were given the go ahead to adopt him. And I got some paperwork in the mail. It was an adoption subsidy agreement. And next to the name of our adorable, funny, very loved and very wanted son was the reason for the monthly subsidy that he was going to get on. And it was checked off. Child is hard to place African-American. And I felt like I had been punched in the stomach. And then one day we got a phone call from our case worker. And I wasn't expecting it. And I could tell something was up. And I was right because she said, do you have room for another baby? And we weren't really planning on having any more children. But we loved our little son so much. We loved any sibling of his. And so I said, what is it? And she said, a boy. And so I cried a little when I said, OK. And then I said, I guess I better call my husband and ask him real quick though. So then we were up to four children, one girl and three boys. And I was pretty sure that I was done with babies. But then I went to a baby shower. And all the new mom was opening up all these tiny little socks and really cute onesies and things. And all the women were just gushing. And I realized that I was sitting like a little bit away from the rest of them. And just thinking, that looks like more laundry to me. So then I really knew that I was done with babies until I got a phone call about our boys, baby, sister. And could we come get her? Like, today, did we have a car seat? And so even though we knew it meant getting on another two-year emotional roller coaster, we borrowed a car seat and said, yes. Six years after starting our fostering experience, we had adopted each of our children. We got to say goodbye to the judges and the case workers and good riddance to the one that we referred to as the anti-social worker. And hello to the architect and the contractors. Lessons were still being learned. And mistakes were being made. I can admit that I have been that white mom out at the store when a black woman told me that my baby's hair felt a little bit dry. And I knew I had to learn from all these different sources, the black community, adult adoptees, more experienced, transpiratially adoptive families, and all while trying to balance it with what it meant to be our family. In this time and in this place. And I thought we were doing all right. And then one day my son was getting ready for school. He was six years old and getting ready for first grade. And he was brushing his teeth and he just stopped. And he said, I wish a brown family adopted me. He wasn't upset. He was very matter of fact. Like I want to wear my blue sneakers and I wish a brown family adopted me. But I was stunned. I knew he might say something like that at some point but I just wasn't really expecting it. And so I just tried to stay calm and I said, well, how come? And he said, I want the family to look like me. So I pointed out that his younger brother and sister looked like him. And he said, yeah, but not the whole family. And so I just apologized. I didn't know what else I could possibly do. And I got him off to school. And the whole day I was thinking, what am I going to do about this? And on one hand, I didn't want to do anything. I mean, if the kid seems fine, I don't want to bother him. Get him upset about it. But on the other hand, you have to muddle things up sometimes before you get some clarity. So at bedtime that night I muddled things up. And I asked him, are you still feeling sad that a brown family didn't adopt you? And he didn't say anything. He just nodded, yes. So I said, did anybody do anything or say something recently that made you start to feel that way? And again, he just nodded, no. So now I'm grasping for straws. Did you know that daddy? And I love you very, very, very, very, very much. And again, just a nod, yes. I mean, clearly the kid was not going to help me move the conversation forward at all. So I had no idea what to say. And so I absolutely surprised myself with what came out next. And I said to him, did you know that there's sadness to adoption? And this time his interest was peaked. Because this time he spoke. And he said, no, I didn't. And I said, well, yeah. Most of the time, everybody only talks about how really happy adoption is. And we are so, so happy that you're part of our family. But if the world was perfect and there were never any problems at all, you probably could have just said with your first mommy, don't you think? And this time my boy answered me. It wasn't with a nod or with words, but he sobbed. It wasn't crying over his skinny. He was sobbing over an emotional wound that he didn't know he had. And he still lacked the emotional maturity and the language to really explore it. But there was something about my acknowledging it for him that just unlocked the deepest sob I'd ever heard come out of a little child. And I told him it was OK to be sad about that. And maybe even forever, but that I wanted to help him find peace over it. And would he maybe like to try to meet some more of his birth family? And he said, yes. So I reached out to our last case worker. And I said, I had heard about this great grandma. Can you give me her number or something? And he said, no, I'm actually not allowed to give that out. So I did a little more asking around and some research. And I found out that he could, however, send a letter on my behalf. Now based on my history with the state, I didn't really trust that this was going to happen. But I had to take a chance. I wrote the letter and I sent it and hoped for the best. And it worked because she called us a week or two later. This great grandmother who had worried about them and prayed for them for years. And we went to go meet her immediately. And as soon as we did, all these doors kept opening. Because every time we went, we just would meet a new family member. And each one of them welcomed all of us. Our adopted kids, our biological kids, my husband and myself with open arms. And all these relationships that could have felt awkward or strange just never did. And our children thrived because of it. And that was four years ago. And on a more recent visit, I was sitting catching up with the kids auntie, like on a couch over here. And I could see my husband eating and talking with another family member over there. And some of my kids were doing crafts with some cousins and others were running around playing ninja turtles with other cousins. There was pop-up sitting on the couch, and he had the TV on the nature channel way too loud. Like he always has it. And I know that now. And there was my son just snuggled up by his side and treating wild animal facts with his grandfather. And looking around the room that day, I sat to myself growing up, I always thought that adoption just meant a new family for the children that are adopted. But looking around here, I know that in our case, it means so much more because it's a family for all of us."
59,haveyoumethimyet.wav," In 2008, I was one of those young people who became obsessed with Barack Obama. I was a senior in college at the time, and after I graduated, I drove out to Ohio, and I worked on his campaign. And after the campaign, I drove to Washington because, hoping to change. And two years later, the White House actually hired me. They hired me to write speeches. And people would hear about my new job, and they would say, wow, you must be really good. And I'd say, I don't know, I hope so. And they thought I was pretending to be humble, but I was entirely sincere. It's not that I didn't think I had any talent whatsoever. It's just that I knew there are 300 million people in America, and some of them are babies. But a lot of them are adults. And it just seemed unlikely that I was the best we the people could do. So every day, I walked through the gates of the White House absolutely sure somebody had made a mistake. And while this was going on, my friends and family were equally sure they now had direct access to the president of the United States. Like, I'm sitting in my White House office, and I get a text from my sister, Rebecca, and it says, how come the Department of Homeland Security doesn't have a mailing address? Now, even in the best of circumstances, this is a disturbing question to get from a family member. But if you work in the White House, you want to know the answer to this kind of stuff, and I have no idea. And it's like this with everything. I mean, suddenly, everyone has a law that only I can get through Congress. Everybody has something wrong with Obamacare that I need to know about. Mostly, everybody has the same question. They all want to know, have you met him yet? Have you met Obama yet? And I say, no, I haven't met him yet, and I get this look. And it's a look I soon learn means you may be 24 years old and working at the White House, but you're still a disappointment to your family and friends. And I have to say, I totally get it. I mean, everybody thinks that the White House is either like the TV show The West Wing, where everyone's hanging out with the president, or it's like the TV show Scandal, where everyone's having sex with the president. But if you're looking for Hollywood analogy, the White House is like the Death Star. What I mean by that is just that there's thousands of people that run around the hallways. They're all just trying to make sure their little bit of their job works well. And just because Darth Vader is the public face of the organization, it doesn't mean that every stormtrooper gets personal one on one time. So I try to explain this whole Death Star thing, and it doesn't work. I still get that disappointed look. And frankly, nobody's more disappointed than I am. I mean, nobody wants me to meet the president more than me. And there's two reasons for this. The first is kind of corny, but it's true. I moved to Washington because I thought, I don't know what it is, but there must be something I can do for my country. I want to be the kind of person where the president of the United States is just a little bit better at his job, because I'm in the room. And the second reason is I would really like Barack Obama and I to become best friends. Now, I'm not saying that every White House staffer imagined that they would become buddies with the president. I'm just saying that none of us ruled it out. Like you would hear these stories. You know, somebody got a fist bump in the hallway or someone else got invited up to play cards on Air Force One. And the moral was always the same. Any moment could be the moment that changes your life forever. Now, my first chance at a life-changing moment came in November 2011 when I was asked to write the Thanksgiving video address. I will say up front if state of the union is all the way on one end of the presidential speech writing spectrum. Happy Thanksgiving America is kind on the other side. But as far as I was concerned, this was the most important set of words Barack Obama would ever say. And so I threw myself into this. I mean, I wrote and I rewrote and I made edits and then I made edits to the edits. And finally, the day of the taping came and I went to the diplomatic room, which is one of the most beautiful rooms in the White House. It has this wraparound mural of 19th century American life. And the advice I always got was you have to act like you've been there before. So I'm standing there, trying to act like I've been there before. And the woman behind the camera takes one look at me and goes, this is your first time here, isn't it? And I crack immediately. I'm just like, yes, I have never been here before. Please help me. And she says, don't worry. She explains her name as Hope Hall. She films the president all the time. She's going to take care of everything. All I have to do is wait. So I wait. And I wait. And I wait. And I wait. And just when I'm wondering, is this whole thing a nightmare? Is it a practical joke? Somebody gets an email on their blackberry and they say, okay, he's moving. And then there's kind of a crackling in the air. And a minute later, President Obama enters the room. And he's standing up, so we all stand up. And he sits down, so we all sit down. And he looks at the camera to start taping when Hope stops him. And she says, actually, Mr. President, this is David. This is the first video he's ever written for you. And he says, and Obama looks at me. And he says, oh, how's it going, David? I had exactly one thought in that moment. I did not realize we were going to have to answer questions. And I have literally no idea what I said after that. And I actually blacked out. Like I went home for Thanksgiving and my family was like, so have you met him yet? And I was like, yeah, and they were like, what did he say? And I was like, how's it going? And they were like, what did you say? And I was like, I don't know, I blacked out. And I get that disappointed look. And I can't blame anybody because if I'm going to be the kind of person who makes the president a little bit better at his job when I'm in the room, I am going to have to deal with questions more complicated than how's it going? And at the moment, there's no indication that I can do it. But I make a promise to myself. I say, if I ever get another shot at a life-changing moment, I am not going to let myself down. And I didn't know if it would ever happen for me. But in fact, it happened just a couple weeks later. I was sitting in my office. I got a phone call from the chief speechwriter at the time. I got my name John Favreaux. And he called me up and he said, Betty White is turning 90 years old. And NBC is doing this special where different famous people wish her a happy birthday in these 30-second skits. And you're pretty funny and no one else wants to do it. Want to give it a shot. And I said, absolutely. And again, I understand state of the union is over here. And happy birthday, Betty White is over there. But this was Mike Gettysburg address. And so we had one week to make it perfect. We started off, John and I came up with a joke for the president. We were going to have him fill out a birthday card. And then while he was filling it out, he would hear his voice on a voiceover say, Dear Betty, you're so young and full of life, I can't believe you're turning 90. In fact, I don't believe it. Please send a copy of your long-form birthday certificate to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, DC. So we feel good about the joke, but we still need a birthday card. So one day that week, I go to CVS near the White House. It's a half block away. I grab a birthday card that I think is going to be pretty good. And then right when I'm about to leave, I realize we are actually one birthday card. We need two identical birthday cards. Because we have two different camera angles. We don't want anyone to know that the president has already written his birthday greeting. And I think, yes, this is how White House staffers are supposed to feel. I mean, I've saved the day. And so I walk back to that hallmark rack and I get an identical card and I ring it up and I go back to my office and I'm feeling really good. And then the last thing we need, we need some way to end the video. And so what I come up with is we're going to have the president put in headphones and then he'll listen to the theme song from the Golden Girls, which is Betty White's most popular show. So I find the perfect pair of headphones. They go over the ear. They'll look great on camera. And I listen to the Golden Girls theme song on repeat just to get in the mood. And then finally on Friday, I get the call. Come on over. Now here's what they don't tell you about having a meeting in the Oval Office. When you have a meeting in the Oval Office, you do not just walk into the Oval Office. The first thing you do, you wait in this kind of windowless chamber. It's a little like a doctor's office except instead of last year's Marie Claire magazine, they have priceless pieces of American art. And instead of receptionists, they have a man with a gun who in a worst case scenario is legally obligated to kill you. It turns out this little room is the perfect place to second guess every life choice you have ever made. And so I'm sitting there with Hope Hall, the videographer, and I'm just thinking, do I remember how to explain the joke? Or both of the birthday cards in there. I check my pants pocket. Or the headphones still there. Or the headphones still there. I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown when finally one of the president's aides pokes her head out and says, okay, he's ready for you. Go on in. To my credit. The first time I entered the Oval Office, I do not black out. I can remember this very clearly. Right in front of me, I can see a painting of the Statue of Liberty that was done by Norman Rockwell and that someone has told me is valued at $12 million. And behind me, out of the corner of my eye, I can see the Emancipation Proclamation. Not a photocopy of the Emancipation Proclamation, the Emancipation Proclamation. And I can feel the message that this document is sending through the room. And that message is, I'm here because I freed the slaves. What are you doing here? And I look across the desk at the president and I realize he may also be wondering what I'm doing here. But I feel great. I mean, I've spent an entire week just practicing how to explain this one joke to the president. So I step up, I look at him and I open my mouth. And what comes out is like I'm trying to ask for directions but in Spanish. Like the nouns and the verbs are there but there's nothing in between them. I just say, Betty White, video, NBC, very funny, everybody laughs, Stabian. And the president gives me kind of a confused look. And I hope the videographer jumps in and explains everything and rescues me. But I'm a little concerned because I am here to show the president how professional I am and in my professional opinion, we are not off to a great start. Still, I'm not that worried because I have that second birthday card in my pocket. And so I'm going to get a chance to show President Obama how I save the day. And as soon as hope is finished filming, even I am surprised by how confident I sound when I walk up to the desk and I put my hand down and I say, Mr. President, I'm going to need to take that birthday card and replace it with this identical birthday card because we don't want anyone to know you've already written your birthday greeting. And President Obama looks up at me and he says, we're filming this from all the way across the room. And I say, yes, that's right. And he says, so no one's going to see the inside of the card. And I say, yes, that's right. And he says, so I can just pretend to write in the card, we don't actually need another one. And I say, yes, that's right. And I put the card back in my pocket and it's strike two. But I'm not giving up yet because I made that promise to myself. And besides, I really do feel good about the ending with the headphones. And so the moment hope is done filming her second camera angle, I walk back up to the President and I reach into my pocket and I pull out what looks like a hairball made out of wires. I don't really know what happened. I guess somewhere in that waiting room, I have just worried this thing into a hopeless tango. And now I don't know what to do so I just hand the entire thing to the President of the United States. Now, if you work in the White House, you will hear the phrase, there is no commodity on earth more valuable than a President's time. Which I always thought was a cliche until I watched Barack Obama untangle headphones for 30 seconds while looking directly at me. And he untangles and untangles and when he finishes, he looks at hope and just goes, shoddy advance work. And he does it in this way that lets you know that he's only joking and B, he is not even a tiny bit joking. And I'll tell you, my heart just sinks. I mean, this was my third chance to make a second first impression on the President. And I let myself down. And all I want to do is get out of there. And President Obama says something like, well, would it be funnier if I bob my head in time to the music? And I say, yeah, that would be funnier. But my heart isn't in it. I mean, I know I don't belong there. And he looks into the camera to tape this final scene. And then suddenly he stops. And he says, well, wait a second, if I'm going to bob my head in time to the music, I need to know how the music goes. Does anyone here know the Golden Girls theme song? And President Obama looks at hope and hope doesn't say anything. So I look at hope and hope doesn't say anything. So President Obama looks at me. And suddenly I know exactly what I can do for my country. And so I'm standing there in the Oval Office with the emancipation proclamation right behind me. And I look at our commander in chief in the eye. And I say, Thank you for being a friend. Travel down the road and back again. Something, something you're a pal and a confidant. But he looks kind of amused. So I keep going. I'm like, and if you threw a party invited everyone you knew. And that's when he gives me a look that's like, okay, President's time. But it works. President Obama bobs his head in time to the music and Betty White gets her card and NBC gets her special. And I leave the Oval Office that day with my head held high knowing that the president of the United States was just a tiny bit better at his job because I was in the room. And people still ask me after that. They still say, have you met him yet? Have you met Obama yet? And I can finally say, yeah, actually I have. And then just in myself, I think, not to brag or anything. But technically, I'm thankful he's a friend. Thank you very much."
60,googlingstrangersandkentuckybluegrass.wav," Let's begin with Kentucky Bluegrass, by which I mean the plant species, not the four-star music genre. Poe pretenses its scientific name is ubiquitous the world over. Much of the time you see a soft green expanse of lawn in Europe or Asia or the Americas, you're looking at least in part at Kentucky Bluegrass. The typical shoot of Poe pretenses has three to four leaves, shaped like little canoes, and if left unmoan, it can grow to three feet tall and sprout blue flower heads. Of course, it usually isn't left unmoan, at least not in my neighborhood, where I believe it is technically illegal to allow your grass to grow more than six inches long. If you've ever driven through my home state of Indiana, you've seen mile after mile after mile of cornfields. Amber waves of grain are enshrined in the song America the Beautiful, and yet more land and more water are devoted to the cultivation of lawn grass in the United States than to corn and wheat combined. There are around 128,000 square kilometers of lawn in the United States, greater than the size of Ohio or the entire nation of Italy. About a third of all residential water use in the US, clean, drinkable water is used to water lawns. To thrive, Kentucky Bluegrass often requires fertilizer and pesticides and extensive watering, and it cannot be eaten or used for anything except walking and playing on. In short, the US's most abundant and labor intensive crop is pure unadulterated luxury. Well, but at least you say Kentucky Bluegrass is a native crop, a plant that evolved in the rolling hills of America and spread through its own suitability, and no, no, Kentucky Bluegrass is not from Kentucky. It is native to Europe, Northern Asia, and parts of North Africa. It was brought to Kentucky and the rest of the Americas by early European settlers. The word lawn, as it is used today, actually didn't even exist until the 1500s. It probably originally referred to expanses of grass shared by communities to feed grazing livestock, as opposed to fields, which denoted land used to grow plants for human consumption. But by the 18th century in England, ornamental lawns similar to the ones we know now had emerged. Back then, lawns were maintained by sides and shears, making them extraordinarily labor intensive. To maintain a lawn without the help of grazing animals was a sign that you were rich enough to hire lots of gardeners, and also to own land that did nothing but look pretty. The ornamental lawn fads spread throughout Europe and also to the United States, where Thomas Jefferson's slaves maintained a closely moaned grass at Monticello, his estate. And then in the 19th and 20th centuries, as mechanical lawnmowers became available and the cost of lawn maintenance dropped, it seemed that everyone wanted a lawn. The quality of lawns in neighborhoods became a proxy for the quality of the neighborhood itself. In the Great Gatsby, for instance, Jay Gatsby pays for his gardeners to mow his neighbor's lawn before Daisy Buchanan visits. It is truly staggering how much money and time and resources we devote to Kentucky bluegrass and its cousins. To minimize weeds and make our lawns as thickly monocultured as possible, we use ten times more fertilizer and pesticide per acre than is used in corn or wheat fields. To keep all the lawns in the U.S. green year-round requires, according to a NASA study, around 200 gallons of water per person per day. And almost all of the water shooting from sprinklers is treated drinking water. Every year, 12% of the materials that end up in U.S. landfills are grass clippings or other yard waste. We spend tens of billions of dollars a year on lawn maintenance. And in exchange, we get, well, Kentucky Bluegrass provides a good surface for soccer and games of tag. Lones also take some carbon out of the atmosphere, although the millions of gallons of gasoline use to mow them make them an extremely inefficient carbon sink. Kentucky Bluegrass also cools the ground and offers some protection from erosion, and in some cases can reduce fire risk. But there are better, if less conventionally beautiful, alternatives, from natural grasses to a front yard devoted to growing plants that you can, say, eat. It's inaccurate to say that lawns are worthless, but they require an awful lot of care considering what we get from them. I mean, some weeks I've only touched my lawn while mowing it. Or actually, not even then, since I'm wearing shoes. It strikes me as odd that, in contrast to proper gardening, lawn maintenance doesn't involve much physical contact with nature. You're mostly touching the machines that mow or edge the grass, not the plant matter itself. And if you've got the kind of gaspy lawn we're all told to reach for, you can't even see the dirt beneath the thick mat of grass. Mowing Kentucky Bluegrass is an encounter with nature, but the kind where you don't get your hands dirty. I give Poe a pretentious two stars. Okay, let's move on to the practice of googling strangers. So when I was a kid, my mom often told me that everyone had one kind of gift or another inside of them. Maybe you would be an extraordinarily astute listener of smooth jazz, or a defensive midfielder with an uncommon understanding of how to open up space with the perfect pass. But as a child, I always felt like I had no inborn gift. I wasn't a particularly good student. I had no athletic ability. I couldn't read social cues well. I sucked at piano and karate and ballet dancing, and everything else my parents tried to sign me up for. And so I thought myself a person without a specialty. Ordinary, only in the field of being mundane. But as it turned out, my specialty just hadn't been invented yet. Because, and I hope you'll forgive the lack of modesty here, I am really, really good at googling strangers. Sure, I've put in the work Malcolm Gladwell famously said that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert in a field, and I've clocked my 10,000 hours and then some, but also I just have a knack for it. I Google strangers all the time. Like if my wife and I have to attend a party, and I say have to, because that is my relationship with parties, I usually research all the known attendees in advance. Even though, of course, I know it's weird when a stranger tells you that they're in the carpet business and then you answer, oh yeah, I'm aware. Also before you tell me the cute story of how you met your wife, it was in 1981, and you were both working at the same savings and loan institution in Dallas, Texas. She was living at home with her parents Joseph and Marilyn, at least according to census records, while you had recently graduated from Oklahoma Baptist University. How is the carpet business these days? Do you guys have like a rivalry with the hardwood for people? It's horrifying. How much information can be accessed via Google about almost all of us. Of course, the loss of privacy has come with tremendous benefits, free storage of photos and video, a chance to participate in large-scale discourse via social media, and the opportunity to easily keep in touch with friends from long ago. But also, making so much of ourselves available for public consumption makes other people feel comfortable sharing their selves, which in turn makes their selves discoverable by us. This feedback loop, we all want to be on Facebook because everyone else is on Facebook, has led to me making so much of my life publicly available that when creating accounts on new social media platforms, I often struggle to find security questions that can't be answered by studying my old social media accounts. Where did I go to elementary school? That's easy enough to find out. What was the name of my first dog? I've vlogged about our miniature dox and red green. Who was your childhood best friend? You'll find baby pictures of us tagged together on Facebook. What was your mother's maiden name? Oh, you can't be serious. But even though it means that less of our lives belong to us and more of our lives belong to the companies that host and gather our browsing habits and hobbies and key strokes, even though I'm kind of revolted by how easy it has become to scroll through the lives of the living and the dead, even though it all feels a bit too much like an or well novel, I can't outright condemn the googling of strangers. When I was 22, I worked for about six months as a student chaplain at a children's hospital. I thought at the time I wanted to become an episcopal priest, although chaplaincy helped me realize that I was not cut out for the clergy. For starters, I didn't have the strength of faith one needs to survive such work. Also, I fainted a lot. Anyway, once or twice a week, I would spend 24 hours on call, which meant that I'd stay in the hospital with these two beepers. One would go off whenever someone asked for a chaplain, sometimes parents or kids who wanted counseling or prayer. But usually that beeper went off when parents wanted their kids to be baptized immediately, often because the child was about to die. The other pageer buzzed when a serious trauma case was arriving at the hospital. I'll get back to googling, but first I have to tell you this story. So one of my last times on call, the trauma pageer sent me down to the emergency department around five in the morning. A three-year-old child was being wheeled in. He'd suffered severe burns to protect his privacy and also because I find it unbearable to look directly at this memory. I'm not going to describe what happened in detail. But the important thing is that despite the severity of his injury, he was conscious and in terrible pain. Although I'd been around the emergency department for months now and seen all manner of suffering and death, I'd never seen the trauma team so visibly upset. The anguish was just overwhelming. The smell of the burns, the piercing screams that accompanied this little boy's every exhalation. Someone shouted, Chaplain, the scissors behind you. And in a days I brought them the scissors. Someone shouted, Chaplain, the parents. And I realized that next to me, the little boy's parents were screaming, trying to get to their kid. But the doctors and paramedics and nurses needed enough space to work, so I had to ask them to step back. Next thing I know, I'm in the Windows family room in the emergency department. The room they put you in on the worst night of your life. And it's quiet now, except for the sobbing of the couple across from me. They aren't holding hands or anything. They're sitting on opposite sides of the couch, elbows on knees. During my training, they told me that half of marriage is end within a couple years of losing a child. Importantly, I asked them if they want to pray. The woman shakes her head, no. The doctor comes in and says that the kid is in critical condition. The parents only have one question and it's one the doctor can't answer. We'll do everything we can, she says. But your son may not survive. Both the parents collapse. Not against each other, but into themselves. Of course, we're able to navigate the world knowing that these things happen. We're able to go on, despite the unbearable horror. My chaplaincy supervisor once told me, children have always died. It's natural. That may be true, but I can't accept it. I can't accept it sitting in the window as family room. And I can't accept it now as a father myself. When the kid finally goes upstairs to the ICU and his parents follow, I go to the break room to get a cup of coffee and the doctor is in there, her face hovering over a trashcan that she's been vomiting into. I'm sorry, I say. You did good with them. Thanks for being kind to them, I think it helped. She responds by dry heaving for a while and then says, that kid's going to die and I know his last word. I know the last thing he'll ever say. I don't ask her to tell me what it was and she doesn't volunteer. A week later, I finished the chaplaincy program and immediately dropped out of Divinity School. I tell everyone it's because I don't want to learn Greek, which is true. But the real truth is that I can't cope with the memory of this kid. I still can't cope with it. I think about him every day. I pray for him every day, even after I stop praying about anything else. Every night, still, I say his name and ask God for mercy. Whether I believe in God isn't really relevant. I do believe, however, tenuously, in mercy. As an inveterate Googler, it of course occurs to me that I could just look up his name, but I was always too scared. To Google would be to know one way or another. I'm reminded of that great line from all the King's men. The end of man is knowledge, but there's one thing he can't know. He can't know whether knowledge will save him or kill him. The months of not knowing become years and then more than a decade. And then one morning, not long ago, I typed the kid's name into the search bar. It's an unusual name, easy pickings for Google. I hit enter and the first link was to a Facebook. I clicked over and there he was, 18 years old, a decade and a half removed from the one day we spent together. He looked healthy. All of his pictures involved silly filters from Snapchat with his girlfriend. He's alive. He is alive. He's growing up, finding his way in the world, documenting a life that is more public than he probably realizes. But how can I not be grateful for knowing even if the only way to know is to lose our autonomy over our so-called selves? He is alive. He likes John Deere tractors and is a member of the future farmers of America, and he is alive. Scrolling through his friends, I find his parents profiles and discover that they are still married. He is alive. He likes terrible, overly manufactured country music, and he is alive. He calls his girlfriend his Bay. Alive. Alive. Alive. I don't message him. I don't friend him. I let him be. It could have gone the other way, of course. But it didn't. I give the practice of Googling strangers to and a half stars."
61,canadageeseandddp.wav," Hello, and welcome to the Anthropocene Reviewed, a podcast where we review facets of the human-centered planet on a five-star scale. My name is John Green, and here in our first episode, I'll be reviewing Canadian Geese and Diet Dr. Pepper. Okay, let's begin with the Canadian Goose, also known as the Canada Goose if you're one of those pedantic people who likes to point out that geese have no nationality. You probably know the bird in question, the brown-bodied black-necked honking waterfowl, ubiquitous in suburban North America, and now also in Europe and New Zealand. With a song like a dying balloon and a penchant for attacking humans, the Canada Goose is hard to love. But then again, so are most of us. These days, the world contains between 4 and 5 million Canada geese, although from where I'm sitting in Indianapolis, that estimate seems low, as there appear to be 4 or 5 million just in my backyard. Hardless, their numbers are growing, but they were once exceptionally rare. In fact, the subspecies you're most likely to see in parks and by retention ponds, the giant Canada Goose was believed to be extinct early in the 20th century due to year-round unrestricted hunting. Canada geese were particularly susceptible to so-called live decoys. Hunters would capture geese and render them flightless, and then the call of these captured geese would attract flocks of wild ones, which could then be shot. But in 1935, live decoys were made illegal, and geese populations began to recover, very slowly at first, and then spectacularly. In 1955, only 20 Canada geese spent part of their year in Ohio. Today, there are over 130,000 geese in Ohio. Non-native populations of geese from New Zealand to Scandinavia have also exploded, and written the Goose population has risen by a factor of at least 20 in the last 60 years. This success is partly down to those laws protecting the birds, but mostly because in the past several decades, humans have rendered lots of land perfect for geese. Heavy landscape suburbs, riverside parks, and golf courses with water features are all absolutely ideal living conditions for them. Geese also enjoy rural fields near rivers and lakes, but the ratio of city geese to country geese in the United States is actually quite similar to the human ratio. At any given time, about 80% of American humans are in or near urban areas. For Canada geese, it's about 75%. And the anthropocene is also changing the way geese live. Between their idyllic suburban lives and climate change, less and less of the population is even bothering to migrate these days. Flux of geese in their famous V formations can travel up to 1500 miles per day with a tailwind. They've been known to fly from North America to Europe. But every year, more geese either shorten their migrations or don't migrate at all. And in this respect, they also reflect humans in the United States. 20% of Americans moved between 1955 and 1956. Between 2015 and 2016, just over 11% did. Like geese, Americans are becoming more likely to die near where they were born with each passing year. In fact, the more you look at it, the more connections you find. Like us, they usually mate for life, although sometimes unhappily. Like us, the success of their species has affected their habitats. A single Canada goose can produce up to 100 pounds of excrement per year, which is glad to unsafe E. coli levels in lakes and ponds. And like us, they have few natural predators. If they die by violence, it is almost always human violence, just like us. But even though Canada geese are perfectly adapted to the human-dominated planet, they seem to feel nothing but disdain for actual humans. Geese honk and strut and bite to keep people away, even though they're thriving because of our artificial lakes and manicured lawns. In turn, many of us have come to resent Geese as a pest animal, I know I do. But they also allow me to feel like there's still some proper nature in my highly sanitized, biologically monotonous, suburban life. Even if Geese have become mundane, there's still something awe-inspiring about seeing them fly overhead in perfect formation, more than pigeons or mice or rats, Geese still feel wild to me. So for me at least, it's a kind of symbiotic relationship in which neither party really much likes the other. Speaking of which, just before graduating from college, I fell in love with a girl, and one day we were driving in her ancient blue hatchback to pick up some groceries, and she asked me what my biggest fear was, and I said, abandonment. I was worried this girl would eventually break up with me, and I wanted her to comfort me, to tell me that I need not fear being alone because she would always be there, and etc. But she wasn't the sort of person to make false promises, and while I don't wish to generalize, most promises featuring the word always are unkeepable. I mean, everything ends, or at least everything humans have thus far observed ends. Anyway, after I said abandonment, she just nodded, and then I filled the awkward silence by asking her what her biggest fear was. Geese, she said. And who can blame her? I mean, it was a flock of Canada geese that flew a suicide mission into the engines of US Airways Flight 1549 in 2009, forcing Captain Sully Selenberger to splash land the aircraft on New York's Hudson River. In 2014, a Canadian cyclist spent a week in the hospital after being attacked by a Canada goose. You can do something about abandonment. You can construct a stronger independent self, for instance, or build a broader network of meaningful relationships, so your psychological well-being isn't wholly reliant upon one person, but you as an individual can't do much about the Canada goose. And that seems to me one of the great weirdnesses of the Anthropocene. Collectively, we have unprecedented power. For better or worse, land has become ours. It is ours to cultivate, to shape, even ours to protect. We are so much the dominant creature on this planet that we essentially decide which species live and which die, which grow like the Canada goose, and which decline like it's cousin the spoon-build sandpiper. Since the Colombian exchange began in 1492, we've changed the temperature of the planet and reshaped its biosphere on a scale not seen in millions of years. Our species is shaping every aspect of life on Earth. But as an individual, I don't feel that power. I can't decide whether a species lives or dies. I can't even get my kids to eat breakfast. In the daily grind of a human life, there's a lawn to mo, soccer practices to drive to, a mortgage to pay. And so I go on living the way I feel like people always have, the way that feels like the right way, and feels at times like the only way. I mow the lawn as if lawns are natural when, in fact, we didn't invent the suburban American lawn until 160 years ago. And I drive to soccer practice, even though that was also impossible 160 years ago, not only because there were no cars, but also because soccer hadn't been invented. And I pay the mortgage, even though mortgages as we understand them today weren't widely available until the 1930s. All of this and so much more happened in the last 1,000th of human history. So much of what feels inevitably, inescapably human to me is, in fact, very, very new, including the every-werness of the Canada goose. So yeah, as both a species and a symbol, I feel deeply unsettled about the Canada goose. In a way, it's become my biggest fear. The goose isn't to blame, of course, but still, I can only give it three stars. The story of Dr. Pepper begins in 1885 in Waco, Texas. A pharmacist named Charles Alderton combined 23 flavors to create a new kind of carbonated drink. This was one year, by the way, before the first appearance of Coca-Cola. Notably, Alderton sold the recipe for Dr. Pepper after a few years because he wanted to pursue his passion, pharmaceutical chemistry. He worked at the drug company Eli Lilly before going back to his hometown to head up the laboratory at the Waco drug company. Alderton's soda probably would have remained a Texas-only phenomenon, disappearing like so many other soda flavors. The opera bouquet, the swizzle fizz, the almond sponge, had it not been for the doggy determination of one Woodrow Wilson clements, who preferred to be called Futs, a nickname he picked up in high school due to his oddly-shaped toes. Futs started out as a Dr. Pepper salesman in 1935 when he was 20. He retired 51 years later as CEO of a soft drink company worth over $400 million. Today, the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, which owns 7-up, RC-Colva, and four different root-beer brands, is valued at over $17 billion. Almost all of their products are some form of sweetened water. Futs clements succeeded because he understood precisely what made Dr. Pepper significant. I've always maintained, he said, you cannot tell anyone what Dr. Pepper tastes like because it's so different. It's not an apple, it's not an orange, it's not a strawberry, it's not a root-beer, it's not even a cola. Cola, after all, is derived from cola nuts and vanilla to real world flavors. Sprite has that lemon lime taste. Purple soda is ostensibly grape flavored, but Dr. Pepper has no natural world analog. In fact, US trademark courts have tackled this issue, categorizing Dr. Pepper and its knockoffs as pepper sodas, even though they contain no pepper and the pepper in Dr. Pepper refers not to the spice, but either to someone's actual name or else to Pepp, the feeling that Dr. Pepper supposedly fills you with. It's the only category of soda not named for what it tastes like, which to my mind is precisely why Dr. Pepper marks such an interesting and important moment in human history. It was an artificial drink that didn't taste like anything. It wasn't like an orange but better or like a lime but sweet. In an interview, Charles Alderton once said that he wanted to create a soda that tasted like the soda fountain in Waco smelled. All those artificial flavors swirling together in the air. Dr. Pepper is, in its very conception, unnatural, the creation of a chemist. But right, so Footh's Clements was the head of the company in 1962 when the first Diet Dr. Pepper was released once again beating Coca-Cola, which debuted its Diet Coke in 1963. The so-called Dietetic Dr. Pepper was initially a failure, the name led many to conclude it was only for diabetics and also apparently it tasted pretty bad. But Diet Dr. Pepper became a huge success when reformulated in 1991 with a new artificial sweetener as per tame and a brand new advertising slogan. And Dr. Pepper, it tastes more like regular Dr. Pepper. Which it really does. Coke and Diet Coke are barely recognizable as relatives. If Coke is a golden eagle, Diet Coke is a hummingbird. But Dr. Pepper and Diet Dr. Pepper taste like each other, which is especially interesting since as Footh's pointed out, neither of them tastes like anything else. Now many people find the artificiality of Diet Dr. Pepper revolting. You often hear people say there are so many chemicals in it. Of course there are also lots of chemicals in wine and in coffee and in air. But the underlying concern I think is that Diet Dr. Pepper is just so profoundly artificial. But that's why I love it. Diet Dr. Pepper allows me to enjoy a relatively safe taste that was literally engineered for me. When I drink it, I think of the kids at that soda fountain in Waco, Texas, most of whom rarely knew the pleasures of an ice cold drink of any kind and how totally enjoyable those first Dr. Pepper's must have been. I mean look what humans can do. They can make ice cold sugary sweet zero calorie soda that tastes like everything and also like nothing. Obviously, I don't labor under the delusion that Diet Dr. Pepper is good for me. But in moderation, it also probably isn't bad for me. It's certainly healthier than regular Dr. Pepper. The evidence that sugar, sweet and drinks are unhealthy is at this point overwhelming. In fact, just as you can construct foot's clements as a hero of American industry, you can also see him as a man who became very rich by giving people diabetes. And I know there's an extremely pervasive belief that artificial sweeteners cause cancer, but the data just doesn't support it. And now we have many decades of information to work with. Diet Dr. Pepper probably doesn't help you lose weight and drinking too much of it can be bad for your teeth and may increase other health risks. But as Dr. Aaron Carroll puts it in his book The Bad Food Bible, there's a potential and likely very real harm from consuming added sugar. There is likely none from artificial sweeteners. And yet, I'll confess that I feel as if I'm committing a sin whenever I drink Diet Dr. Pepper. I mean, nothing that sweet can be truly virtuous. But it's an exceptionally minor vice. And for whatever reason, I've always felt like I need a vice. I don't know whether this feeling is universal, but I have some way down vibrating part of my subconscious that needs to self-destruct, at least a little bit. In my teens and early 20s, I smoked cigarettes compulsively 30 or 40 a day. The pleasure of smoking for me wasn't about a buzz. The pleasure came from the jolt of giving into an unhealthy physical craving, which over time increased my physical cravings, which in turn increased the pleasure I experienced when giving into them. I haven't smoked in more than 15 years now, but I don't think I ever quite escaped that cycle. There remains this yearning within my subconscious that cries out for a sacrifice. And so I offer up the faintest shadow of a proper vice I can find in the form of Diet Dr. Pepper, the soda that tastes more like the Anthropocene than any other. After going through dozens of slogans through the decades, Dr. Pepper build itself is tasting like liquid sunshine as the Pepper Picker-Upper, as the most original soft drink ever. These days, their slogan is more to the point. They call it the One You Crave. I give it 4.5 stars."
62,golfclubbing.wav," Remember the first car I ever got was actually two scars and I was about six years old teaching my little buddy next store how to golf. And I'd taken my dad's bag of golf clubs and dragged it out in the yard and just wanted to show my little buddy had to hit the ball. So I stood behind him and I had him choke up on the nine iron and was telling him, you know, put the tee in the ball and I was just all gung ho to be a little teacher and he I stood back and I had coached him on the back swing and the follow through. He wailed back and hit me in the head and came around and hit me in the head again. And the nine iron took a chunk out of the back right quarter of my scalp, peeled about a palm sized flap of skin and hair. And on the on the back swing hit me on this side and two giant flaps of skin peeled off my skull. And I wasn't sure what happened but he turned around and he looked at me and the blood, you know, head wound is the blood just starts pouring down and I put my hands up and I feel the soft wet part and then the little bristly hairy part. Because I had a crew cut at the time so I pushed my scalp back off and I went running into my house and I'll never forget to look on my mother's face. She's in the kitchen with her cat's eyes glasses talking on the phone and it was one of those black rotary dial phones and she let go of the phone. I had blood running down on my arms and all over my little white t-shirt and she just made this dying pigeon noise and then the first thing she did because I had my younger brother and my younger sister. She called the neighbor to come and watch them and then she called my dad and told him to meet us at the emergency room and she threw me in the convertible and off we flew and she was just locked on driving like a mother to save her kid and we pull up to the emergency room and that was a lackland air force base in Texas 1969. My dad was a drill sergeant so his job all day long was to yell at guys, tell them that they were no good and we're going to die in Vietnam and that his grandmother could do everything they could do but better. My dad was a badass. My dad has like the 10, if you ever seen full metal jacket my dad would kick his ass. Rolled up sleeves, the 10 uniform, the smokey the bear hat and what I never realized at the time or until much later is that at that time my dad was 26 years old and my mom was 25. So they bundled me in to the emergency room or actually my dad hadn't gotten there yet and so the doctor lays me up on the table and does a little pump and I come up and he's looking at me and he's like, are you okay? I'm okay, yeah, I'm okay. And then in comes my dad and he's got the smokey the bear hat, he's like, where's my son? There I am, he's trenched in blood on the table and the doctor's like, well we're just you know got a shave a little bit there and then we got to stitch him up and my dad's air and he's holding my foot and he's looking at me and he's like, are you okay? But I heard, are you okay? So I was like, yes sir, okay, no problem. And the doctor then looked at my dad and he goes, I got to you know, you got to realize if you've never been to an Air Force hospital that's not exactly like, you know, they do it on TV, it's kind of ad hoc. So he forgot something or they're, you know, he needed some extra parts or whatever. So he tells my dad, just stay here, I got to go get the needle or something. I'm there and I'm looking at my dad and I'm got to impress him that I'm okay and he's looking at me and he's like, sure you're okay. I'm like, yeah dad, don't worry. And he's there with his, you know, smokey the bear hats. This is like, I can't even describe to you what the drill sergeant aspect is unless you've lived it. He looks at me and he's holding my foot and his eyes roll back in his head and he drops. And I think that he's trying to make me laugh. So I'm thinking, dad's just trying to give me a little encouragement. I'm there like laughing. On the way down, my father hid his head on the end of that metal table. So bad. It caught his eye socket and ripped himself a scar. And he's like, I'm not going to be a family and they're going, dad, that's funny. Where are you? And then the surgeon comes in and is like, what the fuck? He's like, get up. And he picks me up and I help my dad who is completely unconscious in a giant pool of blood with his tan uniform completely drenched. We help my father. He lowers the table. We get my dad onto the thing. He's stitching my dad up and I'm watching and helping everything. And I'm just like bundled up. It's a guy just like wrapped me real quick. And my dad is out like out cold. And this surgeon's like, gives him like 16 stitches from the corner of his eye all the way back up. And I'm like, oh, wow. I'm into it. I want my dad to be better. And then the surgeon's like, all right. And he goes and gets a wheelchair. And he's like, help me put your dad in the chair. We load my dad in the chair. And then he stitches me up. But can he knew mine were just superficial scalp bones? So then we get, I'm all stitched up and then he wraps my whole head up. And I got the big, you know, due tip looking head with the blood spots soaking through. And then they put my dad in the wheelchair. And my dad is still out. And the surgeon goes just to push him out to your mom, okay? And my mother is in the waiting room. And I come out pushing my father in the wheelchair. But I'm only about this tall. So I'm kind of looking over the side. And I'll never forget to look at my mother's face. Just thank God she was sitting down when she fainted."
63,igrewupinthewestborobaptistchurch.wav," I was a blue-eyed, chubby, cheeked, five-year-old when I joined my family on the picket line for the first time. My mom made me leave my dolls in the minivan. I'd stand on a street corner in the heavy Kansas humidity, surrounded by a few dozen relatives, with my tiny fists clutching a sign that I couldn't read yet. Gays are worthy of death. This was the beginning. Our protest soon became a daily occurrence and an international phenomenon. And as a member of Westbrook Baptist Church, I became a fixture on picket lines across the country. The end of my anti-gay picketing career and life as I knew it came 20 years later, triggered in part by strangers on Twitter, who showed me the power of engaging the other. In my home, life was framed as an epic spiritual battle between good and evil. The good was my church and its members, and the evil was everyone else. My church's antics were such that we were constantly at odds with the world, and that reinforced our otherness on a daily basis. Make a difference between the unclean and the clean, the verse says. And so we did. From baseball games to military funerals, we trekked across the country with neon protest signs in hand, to tell others exactly how unclean they were, and exactly why they were headed for damnation. This was the focus of our whole lives. This was the only way for me to do good in a world that sits in Satan's lap. And like the rest of my ten siblings, I believed what I was taught with all my heart, and I pursued Westbrook's agenda with a special sort of zeal. In 2009, that zeal brought me to Twitter. Initially, the people I encountered on the platform were just as hostile as I expected. They were the digital version of the screaming hoards I'd been seeing at protests since I was a kid. But in the midst of that digital brawl, a strange pattern developed. Someone would arrive at my profile with the usual rage and scorn. I would respond with a custom mix of Bible verses, pop culture references, and smiley faces. They would be understandably confused and caught off guard. But then a conversation would ensue. And it was civil, full of genuine curiosity on both sides. How had the other come to such outrageous conclusions about the world? Sometimes the conversation even bled into real life. People I'd sparred with on Twitter would come out to the picket line to see me when I protested in their city. A man named David was one such person. He ran a blog called Juliusius. And after several months of heated but friendly arguments online, he came out to see me at a picket in New Orleans. He brought me a Middle Eastern dessert from Jerusalem where he lives. And I brought him kosher chocolate and held a God hates juice sign. There was no confusion about our positions, but the line between friend and foe was becoming blurred. We'd started to see each other as human beings, and it changed the way we spoke to one another. It took time, but eventually these conversations planted seeds of doubt in me. My friends on Twitter took the time to understand Westbro's doctrines, and in doing so, they were able to find inconsistencies I'd missed my entire life. Why did we advocate the death penalty for gays when Jesus said, let he who was without sin cast the first stone? How could we claim to love our neighbor while at the same time praying for God to destroy them? The truth is that the care shown to me by these strangers on the internet was itself a contradiction. It was growing evidence that people on the other side were not the demons I'd been led to believe. These realizations were life-altering. Once I saw that we were not the ultimate arbiters of divine truth, but flawed human beings, I couldn't pretend otherwise. I couldn't justify our actions, especially our cruel practice of protesting funerals and celebrating human tragedy. These shifts in my perspective contributed to a larger erosion of trust in my church, and eventually it made it impossible for me to stay. In spite of overwhelming grief and terror, I left Westbro in 2012. In those days just after I left, the instinct to hide was almost paralyzing. I wanted to hide from the judgment of my family, who I knew would never speak to me again, people whose thoughts and opinions had meant everything to me, and I wanted to hide from the world I'd rejected for so long, people who had no reason at all to give me a second chance after a lifetime of antagonism. And yet, unbelievably, they did. The world had access to my past because it was all over the internet, thousands of tweets and hundreds of interviews, everything from local TV news to the Howard Stern Show, but so many embraced me with open arms anyway. I wrote an apology for the harm I'd caused, but I also knew that an apology could never undo any of it. All I could do was try to build a new life and find a way somehow to repair some of the damage. People had every reason to doubt my sincerity, but most of them didn't. And given my history, it was more than I could have hoped for, forgiveness and the benefit of the doubt. It still amazes me. I spent my first year away from home, a drift with my younger sister who had chosen to leave with me. We walked into an abyss, but we were shocked to find light and a way forward. In the same communities, we targeted for so long. David, my Jewish friend from Twitter, invited us to spend time among a Jewish community in Los Angeles. We slept on couches in the home of a acidic rabbi and his wife and their four kids, the same rabbi that I'd protested three years earlier, with a sign that said, you're rabbi as a whore. We spent long hours talking about theology and Judaism and life while we washed dishes in their kosher kitchen and chopped vegetables for dinner. They treated us like family. They held nothing against us. And again, I was astonished. That period was full of turmoil, but one part I've returned to often is a surprising realization I had during that time. That it was a relief and a privilege to let go of the harsh judgments that instinctively ran through my mind about nearly every person I saw. I realized that now I needed to learn. I needed to listen. This has been at the front of my mind lately because I can't help but see in our public discourse so many of the same destructive impulses that ruled my former church. We celebrate tolerance and diversity more than at any other time in memory and still we grow more and more divided. We want good things, justice, equality, freedom, dignity, prosperity, but the path we've chosen looks so much like the one I walked away from four years ago. We've broken the world into us and then only emerging from our bunkers long enough to lob rhetorical grenades at the other camp. We write off half the country as out of touch liberal elites or racist misogynist bullies, no nuance, no complexity, no humanity. Even when someone does call for empathy and understanding for the other side, the conversation nearly always devolves into a debate about who deserves more empathy. And just as I learned to do, we routinely refuse to acknowledge the flaws in our positions or the merits in our opponents. Compromise is anathema. We even target people on our own side when they dare to question the party line. This path has brought us cool sniping, deepening polarization, and even outbreaks of violence. I remember this path. It will not take us where we want to go. What gives me hope is that we can do something about this. The good news is that it's simple and the bad news is that it's hard. We have to talk and listen to people we disagree with. It's hard because we often can't fathom how the other side came to their positions. It's hard because righteous indignation, that sense of certainty that ours is the right side is so seductive. It's hard because it means extending empathy and compassion to people who show us hostility and contempt. The impulse to respond in kind is so tempting, but that isn't who we want to be. We can resist, and I will always be inspired to do so by those people I encountered on Twitter. A parent enemies who became my beloved friends. And in the case of one particularly understanding and generous guy, my husband. There was nothing special about the way I responded to him. What was special was their approach. I thought about it a lot over the past few years, and I found four things they did differently that made real conversation possible. These four steps were small but powerful, and I do everything I can to employ them in difficult conversations today. The first is, don't assume bad intent. My friends on Twitter realized that even when my words were aggressive and offensive, I sincerely believed I was doing the right thing. Assuming ill motives almost instantly cut us off from truly understanding why someone does and believes as they do, we forget that there are human being with a lifetime of experience that shaped their mind, and we get stuck on that first wave of anger, and the conversation has a very hard time ever moving beyond it. But when we assume good or neutral intent, we give our minds a much stronger framework for dialogue. The second is, ask questions. When we engage people across ideological divides, asking questions helps us map the disconnect between our differing points of view. That's important because we can't present effective arguments if we don't understand where the other side is actually coming from, and because it gives them an opportunity to point out flaws in our positions. But asking questions serves another purpose. It signals to someone that they're being heard. When my friends on Twitter stopped accusing and started asking questions, I almost automatically mirrored them. Their questions gave me room to speak, but they also gave me permission to ask them questions, and to truly hear their responses. It fundamentally changed the dynamic of our conversation. The third is, stay calm. This takes practice and patience, but it's powerful. At Westboro, I learned not to care how my manner of speaking affected others. I thought my rightness justified my rudeness. Harsh tones raised voices, insults, interruptions. But that strategy is ultimately counterproductive. Diling up the volume in the stark is natural and stressful situations, but it tends to bring the conversation to an unsatisfactory, explosive end. When my husband was still just an anonymous Twitter acquaintance, our discussions frequently became hard and pointed, but he always refused to escalate. Instead, he would change the subject. He would tell a joke, or recommend a book, or shantley excuse himself from the conversation. We knew the discussion wasn't over, just paused for a time to bring us back to an even queue. People often lament that digital communication makes us less civil, but this is one advantage that online conversations have over in-person ones. We have a buffer of time and space between us and the people whose ideas we find so frustrating. We can use that buffer. Instead of lashing out, we can pause, breathe, change the subject, or walk away, and then come back to it when we're ready. And finally, make the argument. This might seem obvious, but one side effect of having strong beliefs is that we sometimes assume that the value of our position is, or should be, obvious and self-evident, that we shouldn't have to defend our positions, because they're so clearly right and good that if someone doesn't get it, it's their problem, that it's not my job to educate them. But if it were that simple, we would all see things the same way. As kind as my friends on Twitter were, if they hadn't actually made their arguments, it would have been so much harder for me to see the world in a different way. We are all a product of our upbringing, and our beliefs reflect our experiences. We can't expect others to spontaneously change their own minds. If we want change, we have to make the case for it. My friends on Twitter didn't abandon their beliefs or their principles. Only their scorn. They channeled their infinitely justifiable offense, and came to me with pointed questions tempered with kindness and humor. They approached me as a human being, and that was more transformative than two full decades of outrage, disdain, and violence. I know that some might not have the time or the energy or the patience for extensive engagement, but as difficult as it can be, reaching out to someone we disagree with is an option that is available to all of us. And I sincerely believe that we can do hard things, not just for them, but for us and our future. Escalating disgust and intractable conflict are not what we want for ourselves, or our country, or our next generation. My mom said something to me a few weeks before I left Westboro. When I was desperately hoping there was a way I could stay with my family. People I have loved with every pulse of my heart since even before I was that chubby, cheeked five-year-old standing on a picket line holding a sign I couldn't read. She said, you're just a human being, my dear sweet child. She was asking me to be humble, not to question, but to trust God and my elders. But to me, she was missing the bigger picture that were all just human beings, that we should be guided by that most basic fact and approach one another with generosity and compassion. Each one of us contributes to the communities and the cultures and the societies that we make up. The end of this spiral of rage and blame begins with one person who refuses to indulge these destructive seductive impulses. We just have to decide that it's going to start with us. Thank you."
64,kiksuya.wav," So I'm at this party back home in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The evening's winding down and I'm going to try to sneak out when this lady stops me. She just shakes my hand and introduces herself and says that my uncle told her to come talk to me. Now this uncle is not my uncle in the sense of blood relation. He's my uncle Indian way. One of the many men who helped raise me and teach me the things that he knows. Anyways, this lady tells me that a couple friends of hers have fallen in with this older Indian man. And he's performing all these ceremonies and rituals for them which is fine by me. But he's charging money and that is a big taboo in my community. Now as she continues to talk, I start to realize exactly why my uncle centered me because this man that she's describing this possible scam artist is my father. Now when I was a kid, my dad was a very traditional Dakota man devoted to the cultural practices of our people. But over the years things had started to change. He was charging money for ceremonies and taking advantage of people that were just looking for something spiritual in their lives. At this point, I hadn't actually seen my father in over ten years. And for good reason, my family had lived in fear of his violent outbursts afraid that anything that we ever said or did would send him into this rage. So one night my mom, my sister and me, we all snuck out of the house while he slept. And in this quiet, panicked rush, we grabbed what little we could. So a garbage bag full of clothing, half eaten box of twinkies, and our favorite childhood toys. My sister had always carried around this little curious George, but I preferred the dashing ladies man known as Roger Rabbit. So that same uncle stood guard at the front door to make sure that we could escape quietly and safely. But you don't just walk out on a life like that and start over fresh. It was really hard. We bounced around battered women's shelters and slept on people's floors. And as a man, I had been homeless. I couldn't pay my bills. I was really angry and I lashed out and got into trouble with the law. But with the help of my community in Minneapolis, I was able to get on my feet. After all this time went by, I had always wondered, you know, what happened to my father? After we left. Where has he been? And now suddenly this ghost is just tumbling back into my life. It was pretty surreal. I didn't know, honestly, if this was something that I was really ready for, but I decided to call that couple who had been being taken advantage of by my father. They live in a town called Chasuke, or as those Minnesotans say Chiasca. Now, that's only about an hour drive for my apartment. So I tell them that I think their spiritual leader is my father who I haven't seen in over a decade. And they tell me that in just a couple days he'll be driving from his home in South Dakota, all the way to their place in Minnesota. Now, bear in mind, these people think that my dad is some kind of Indian Jesus or something crazy like that. And they're talking to me like I'm royalty. They said, it would be such an honor if you would allow for us to host your family reunion at our next gathering. Now, after everything that had happened, I'm afraid that my dad's going to chicken out if he knows that I'm going to come meet him. So I asked him, you know, I'll come through, but you have to make it a surprise for him. So they agree. Now, I've only got the weekend to get my head on straight, and I cannot get to sleep. I keep rehearsing all these conversations in my mind with him. I keep asking him questions, why? Why did you feel like you could just beat on a small child as if he was a grown man that you hated? How could you be the most terrifying presence in a family that you're supposed to protect? So the night before our scheduled reunion, I came home to an answering machine full of messages from a family friend. He says it's urgent, so I call him back. And he tells me that on the drive from South Dakota to Minnesota, my dad was in an accident. And he was killed. My whole world just shuts down. I started yelling at that guy on the phone. I was crying. I just, I didn't believe him. And so, to this day, you know, I still think that he died on purpose, just to avoid having to look me in the eyes. But I have to go see him. I have to see this for myself. So I called up my sister, and I told her the news of our father's passing. And I called up that couple who had been so excited to host our family reunion, and they are devastated. They say, please, let us drive you and your sister all the way to South Dakota to retrieve your father's body. Now, I really did not want to involve these guys in our situation. But my car had just broke down. I was working a couple of lot jobs just to make ends meet, so with very little resources or options, I grudgingly accept. Now, when you spend so many years bouncing from shelter to shelter, you lose a lot of these items that represent your personal history. Homelessness is in a place for nostalgia. And yet, I had somehow managed to hold on to Roger Rabbit. Now, the Roger Rabbit, you guys know, is white. But my Roger Rabbit was so old and well-loved that he's a light shade of brown now, just like me. So I decided that if I'm going to be traveling back into the past that was so dark for me, then I'm going to bring this little fella who kept baby me safe in a house full of monsters. So my sister and I walk into this couple's house. And it's so kitschy. There were enough dream catchers on the walls to choke a buffalo. I'm not kidding. And there's this huge photo of my father hanging up in the same room that it was taken. And in it, he's talking to this room, full of white people. But they're all dressed like Indians. Honestly, I felt this weird mixture of disgust, but pity. You know, my dad, he was trying to push this sense of quasi-Indianness on these unsuspecting people. But my culture, everything that I believed in was being appropriated and packaged up into some kind of bargain-bind spirituality that was just for people who were missing something in their lives. Now, Dakota people, we believe that it takes the spirit four days to leave the body. And when we get to spearfish South Dakota, it's the fourth and final day since my dad's passing. That is not a coincidence to me. My sister and I decide that we're going to take turns being alone with our father to say what we need to say. And so I walked into this room. It's cold, and it's quiet, except for this hum of a motor. That's preserving the dead. I can see my father's body across the room on this metal table. And he's so still. I had so much to say to this bastard all week. But now, I'm just at a loss for words. His head, it was all misshapen from the accident that killed him. These black tattoos of ancient symbols all over his face were now gray and blurry. I could hardly even recognize this face that had torn my family apart. And so I closed my eyes and I tried to remember all the terrible things that he did to us. But when I look, and I mean really look at him, I can see that life for this man was pain and it was hardship. I can actually see the mental illness that was created by generations of trauma. And so I leaned down and I told that man, I'm your son. I told that pitiful man that I came here to forgive. Afterwards, I went to the car and I laughingly and embarrassingly admitted to my sister that I had brought Roger with me. And she just gets this crazy look on her face. Grab her bag, pulls out curious George. So we decided that we're going to go to Bear Bute, which is nearby. That's a sacred site walked on by our ancestors for thousands of years. We pull up and I told that couple to please stay in the car because this is for family. And that night is so beautiful. There are hundreds of tobacco offerings from other Dakota people tied to trees all along this two mile hike up to the summit of the butte. And standing there, we can see these scattered lights from the town of Sturgis nearby. But right here, it's meditative, dark and quiet. So I light my bundle of sage. And together we smoke the pipe, making our words visible to each other. And we lay our toys on the ground as an offering. And I looked at my sister and I said, you want to light them on fire? And she said, I was thinking the same thing. So I took that bundle of sage and I cremated our childish past. And in a lot of ways, I think that that fire showed us the path to a brighter future. We didn't need protection for monsters anymore because we have each other. It takes a lifetime of work to heal a broken family. But mine is still standing. Thank you."
65,souls.wav," So a lot of people are raised with a religion, and I'm one of those people that was raised with two. There was our official religion. My family is, and I was at the time, conservative evangelical Christians. But then there was our unofficial faith and hope we had in Mary K. Cosmetics. Many of the women in my family had been Mary K. Beauty Consultants since I was a child. And I loved Jesus as long as I could remember, but that Mary K thing was hoping to dodge that bullet. I was this brainy grunge girl from Boulder County. I wore hemp jewelry and clothes from the Salvation Army. I had moral objections to wearing makeup. And when I got a scholarship to go out of state for college, I thought I'd made my big escape. But my last visit home, I listened to one recruiting tape too many. And the logic and reason finally got to me, and I signed the dotted line, and I started my business as a Mary K. Beauty Consultant. Now on paper, the business plan looks foolproof. All you're supposed to need is to have one friend to host a party for you, where you sell skincare and makeup to her friends. Then you're supposed to book two more every time. So your date book is never empty. But I could never book two more. I used the script. I thought I was fun to be with. I don't know what the problem was. But luckily for me, there was like a hundred other ways they trained us to get bookings. And one of these ways was to strike up seemingly natural conversations with perfect strangers. And we had a name for this. We called this warm chatter. And I thought, dammit, I am going to rock this. I'm going to be the queen of warm chatter. So what I'm about to tell you, I did this for a very long time. About two or three days a week for two or three hours a day, I would get dressed up in my business suit. And I put on all my makeup and I packed my bag full of samples and I would drive to target. And in target, I would get my red shopping cart and I pretend I was shopping for items. But really, I was just hunting for women. I was looking for women who looked cute or friendly or approachable. And I found somebody like this, then I would just discreetly follow her through the store until we could be together in an aisle alone. And then I would appear to just be walking by normally. And I would slow down and in the most casual way possible, I would say these words that I'd rehearsed 100 million times. I would say, excuse me, can I ask you a quick question? I'm Jen with Mary Kay. And we just came out with a new line of lip glosses and I need some women's opinions of it. You know, I have some samples here in my bag. Is there any reason why you wouldn't want to take one home and try it? And this part was really important. We are trained to smile and nod while we ask the question. It has to do with the nonverbal communication and mirroring. It's very advanced. And if she said yes, I'd give her the sample. I'd get her phone number when I called her back later to thank her. I would offer her a complimentary appointment with me. And I wouldn't mention that all my appointments were complimentary because it just didn't seem important. So at the same time I was doing this for my career. My husband and I were also helping to lead programs for our local church. And this was the kind of church that was trained to be really hip and modern. It met in a strip mall. And we had a rock band, a rock band leading worship up front. The pastor was this 40-something British guy and he really wanted to attract 20-something. So we were a hot commodity. We were right in the demographic. And we started to get promoted up into higher and higher echelons of leadership. So we were invited to the leadership team meeting and then the core leadership team meeting. And I still remember my first night at one of these meetings. And I don't know exactly what I was expecting. But I think I'd always imagine them to be kind of soulful events. And I was really dismayed to show up and discover it was this really tedious conversation about branding and marketing and what the church's next advertising campaign was going to be. So it didn't take too long before these two worlds. The church in Mary K started to look more and more similar. They both had the lure in Mary K. I was giving out free samples. But at the church we were having free events to try and get people in the doors. In both worlds we were couching everything we did inside a conversation about service. So Mary K's company tagline at the time was changing women's lives. Which if you think about it isn't that different from saving people's souls. And we really believed it. We really thought we were doing this. Even though nobody's motives are that pure. And in both worlds I was being trained all the time to listen to people everywhere I went for whatever was missing or not working about their life and offer what we had as the solution. So if you needed time or money or flexibility Mary K might be perfect for you. But if you're struggling with your marriage or you've had a recent loss, maybe you're questioning the meaning of life. Call me crazy but if you considered maybe Jesus is the answer. And soon I just started to feel like a 24 hour saleswoman and it started to get confusing like which hat I was wearing at which time. Until one day I was in Target with my little red cart. And I saw this lovely looking red head who smiled so big when I smiled at her. And I started into my scripts. Excuse me can I ask you a quick question? Except this time it starts to sound kind of flat like those pull string dolls that sound kind of wonky at the end. Suddenly I was just thinking, does she need Mary K or does she need Jesus? Does she need Mary K or does she need Jesus? And I don't know which one I offered her but she said no because I was acting crazy. And she turned and walked away. And I realized the problem with whenever you have something whether it's a religion or a business or anything else that you think is the right answer for everybody. Through that lens you can't help but look at everyone in the world as if they're broken and need to be fixed. And I didn't want to do that anymore. So I put my car to the front of the store and I drove home. The next night was my weekly success meeting. And the director was up front telling us, giving us all the information about the new lipstick formula. And the changes that were being made. And I started to look around the room at these women. And they were either my friends who I recruited into it or my relatives who had recruited me into it. And I was thinking about how devastating would be when I quit because I wasn't just rejecting everything they stood for. But as letting down my friends, I got them into it. I was bailing on them. And then my relatives, the people who had recruited me, their income depended on me. Their income, their status, all of our fortunes were tied in together. And I thought, but is this really changing women's lives the way I hoped it would? And the directors are passing around mirrors and lipstick samples for us to try it ourselves. And I thought, no, I don't think so anymore. And a couple days later was the church leadership meeting. And the pastor was telling us that the church's new mission statement needed to have five points, one for every finger on the hand so people could remember it. And I started looking around this room and thinking about what they would think about me when I quit. They would think I was backsliding and falling off the wagon, but it was even worse than that. They would think I was going to hell, and my children were going to hell. And if I was wrong, maybe they would be right. And I thought, but is this really saving people's souls, this, all this that we're doing? And the pastor interrupted to say that all five points needed to start with the same letter. And I thought, no, I don't think so anymore. And so that was when I stopped trying to save the world. And I decided to save myself instead from this life I didn't want anymore. And it really cost me. I lost my identity. I lost belonging. I lost the ability to ever be that certain or righteous about anything ever again. And if you can imagine what's like to lose a faith and then imagine what's like to lose two at once. Because even though Mary K was a business, it wasn't just that it was a way I thought the world worked. So way I thought that we could all win and everybody could get what they needed. It was really devastating. I felt like I might not ever be able to trust myself again. The last piece of our exit strategy was our move to New York. We were going to get geographic distance, start fresh someplace else. We landed in Brooklyn in a neighborhood called Park Slope. And everywhere we went, people were either trying to recruit us into or warn us against joining the Park Slope food co-op. And it seemed so unobjectionable. Like who can argue against cheap organic environmentally friendly food, community run? My part of me was really tempted because I thought I can have my identity back. Everyone will know I'm a good person. And I can belong again. But there was something about the way that the people we talked to were just so convinced. It was the right thing for everybody that felt creepily familiar. Because I thought I know where that path leads. So when one particularly zealous friend cornered me one day and said, are you going to join or not? Are you in or are you out? I just took a deep breath and I looked her in the eyes and I said, sorry, I don't do religions anymore. Thank you."
66,thatthingonmyarm.wav," People often ask me how I got the scar on my arm. And what happened was when I was 14 years old, I got really sick, and no one could figure out what was wrong with me. I was very ill and finally, after a week of not getting better, my mother took me to the hospital, and I, after many tests, was finally, days and days later, diagnosed with a hyper allergy, something called Steven's Johnson Syndrome. And once they finally found out what was wrong with me, they treated me for it, but not before I had spent weeks in the hospital, weeks blind and mute as well, as being fed by tubes, and having to sleep, sitting up, so that I wouldn't choke on my own saliva. My mother, in her fashion, moved in to the hospital, to be by my bedside, and slept every night in the hospital to take care of me, and she wouldn't leave my side. And finally, when I was released on February 1st, I remember it was a Friday. As we were writing home in our car, she said, I've made a promise to God that if God delivers you safely out of the hospital that I would go and I would do a penance, and I would go to the temple and make an offering to give thanks for delivering my child home safely. So I know you're really sick, but I'm gonna see if your stepdad can drive us on Sunday to the temple. And I just sort of nodded in my very ill way, and I said, okay, and on that Sunday, February 3rd, my stepfather and my mother and I drove in our red Ford Mercury car, with the black interior, to the Hindu temple, and I was very ill, I was very, very weak and frail. And that was long enough ago. I was 14 a long time ago when they still had the front seat, that was a couch seat. So my mother wedged me in between her and my stepdad because she wanted to take care of me. I was still really sick. I could barely hold my head up. I had lost a lot of weight. I was so weak that she said, you stay in the car, I'll do the offering. She went, she did the prayers, she did the flowers, she rang the bell, she got the food, and they came back in the car, and she handed me the squeaky round Styrofoam plate with a bunch of yellow rice on it and some vegetable curry or whatever it was. And off we went back down the highway, and I remember thinking what a beautiful sunny Sunday it was. And I was trying desperately to concentrate on this plate of food, and my mother said, you know, just try and have a couple bites of it. Just, you know, it's blessed, it's from the Pooja we did. And as I was eating this rice, suddenly I heard a loud bang. And I looked up and I can remember the plate flying and yellow rice everywhere, like confetti. And as the rice came down, all I could see was this beautiful blue sky, this crystal clear blue sky, no clouds, no cars, no road in front of us, no trees, nothing, just endless, miraculous blue sky and these kind of yellow grains flying all around. And then all of a sudden I heard another thud, and then I kind of heard, and it was us, we were flying, and then we were airborne, I realized, and then what stopped our fall was this tree, and then we kind of went down further down this embankment. And then finally came to a last thud, and there was just stillness. I kind of strained my neck and I could see my mother to my right, and we were all pinned very closely together and my mother had her eyes closed and her mouth open and blood was trickling out of the side of her mouth. And to my left, my stepfather was saying over and over again this mantra of, where are we, Vijay? What happened, Vijay? weren't we driving Vijay? We were at the temple, Vijay. Vijay, Vijay, my mother, and from my mother emanated this profound, ennossiating silence. And I started to scream at my mother, I started to say, Mom, are you awake? Are you awake? If you're awake, say something, say something, please. If you're not awake, I love you, mommy, I love you. If you are awake, I love you, but please say something. And in the back of me screaming was this chorus, this non-stop loop of my stepfather, almost like that cliche image, or track that the cartoons, when a bird or cartoon characters hit on the head and they say, where am I? What's going on? That was exactly what he was doing. And he just kept repeating this. And it was, all of a sudden I started feeling things, I started feeling hot and cold and wet and sticky and itchy and burning. And all I could feel from my mother was this silence emanating from her that kept getting louder and louder this silence. Then I finally heard a man call down to us and say, are you okay? Are you okay? So yes, we're alive, we're alive, please get help, please, please get help. And then a bunch of firemen came and I remember hearing the crunch of their boots down the leaves, down the, you know, on the leaves, down the embankment. And they came and, you know, they kind of got, I heard chain saws, I heard a helicopter in the distance approaching. I heard blow torches. I would later learn that they had to use these famous things called the jaws of life to cut open the roof of this red Ford Mercury's Eifer. And so, you know, I got taken to the city of angels and my parents got taken somewhere else. My arm, you know, because we were pinsotight, my arm had flown across my mother's chest. And so my arm was just shattered in many pieces. And I lay there for hours and hours, not knowing what happened to my parents, not knowing if my parents were okay, if my mother was alive. And I remember being incredibly uncomfortable in a cold hospital bed with glass everywhere in every crevice of my body, under my nails, in my hair, in my ears, just shattered glass everywhere. And I remember, you know, in the emergency room, I remember vague bits and pieces of what people said, like, you know, well, I don't think it's worth doing, but, you know, I questioned the mobility of that arm or, wow, let's leave it alone. And we were home, it took us a long time to heal. My stepfather broke his leg, his left leg, and four places is hip and two. My mother had to come home and still have a hospital bed at home for weeks and months. And we had one to one nursing, 24 hours around the clock at home, because of course, my mother this time could not care for me, could not be by my side, and DG had her own hospital bed. But my mother was determined. They said that they weren't gonna do any surgery on my arm because they thought it wasn't really worth it, that it would probably be dormant, be kind of semi-lame at my side. And, you know, I was so young I could learn to do everything with my left hand. And so, my mother was determined not to let this happen. And so she, from her hospital bed at home, ordered me to go to another orthopedist whom she had found on the phone through colleagues, and he said, well, she's so young, we should do it. And he decided to do surgery on my arm, and I got this very beautiful thin scratch of a surgery incision, and there was a cylindrical metal plate that was put on. And as my arm got better, the scar got worse. And, you know, I was very awkward to begin with, and I was 14 at all these hormones and feeling off about my body, and I knew that the scar on my forearm was looking bad, and so I knew what was to come with this scar. And so, anyway, years go by, and I had to have multiple surgeries on the arm. Every time the arm got more and more better, and every time the scar got longer, and thicker, and robier, and darker. And, you know, I kind of found ways to look normal while hiding it, you know? And I would go on dates in college, and I would have to really think about whether I was gonna wear a short-sleeved blouse or a long-sleeved blouse, and then I was studying abroad, and I started modeling of all things. And, you know, I was in a fancy model. I used it, I graduated from college, and then I really started modeling to pay off my college loans. It was a fit model, a work-a-day model. And then this weird thing happened with an agency called me, and they said, guess what? Helmet Newton wants to shoot you. And, you know, I was young, and I was like, who's Helmet Newton? They said, you know, Helmet Newton, the guy he's great, is his beautiful, sexy, dangerous edgy pictures of women and he wants to shoot you. So, you know, before my agency, when they were calling around, so they'd get comments like, you know, she's kind of pretty, but that scar. Those same people were calling, going, can we book the girl with the scar? It's amazing that somebody else thinking you're cool can make you think differently of yourself. And, you know, so all of a sudden, I was doing all these runway shows, you know, I was like doing a bear to Freddy and her Vallejé and all these great. And so, my salary went up and, you know, all of a sudden I was the girl with the scar. So, you know, maybe the scar was this mixed blessing in a way, right? Because it paid off my college loans, and, you know, bought me an apartment, paid off my mom's mortgage, a lot of cool things. So, I thought that was great. And I was thinking about all of this recently, because I found myself on my back in another hospital bed, staring at another white ceiling. And I was told that I would probably never have children naturally, and that was very upsetting, as many women can understand and meant to. And then I got pregnant, which was a real surprise, but a happy one. And then I was told there would be a difficult pregnancy, and then it was a really difficult pregnancy, and I was ordered on complete bedrest, the last trimester of my pregnancy, and my mother in true fashion moved in with me the next day. Yeah, it's true. And, you know, when your mother moves in with you at 39, it's a completely different experience. But there she was, valiant in her nurturing, and it was a very scary last few weeks of the pregnancy. I wind up going to the hospital more than once before I had the baby, and one time for five days with a fetal heart monitor and tubes everywhere, and staring at the ceiling and thinking to myself, God, please get me out of here. Please deliver me and my child intact, and healthy out of this hospital. And I recently, miraculously found myself again, with my mother in another car, this time going to flushing queens, to another temple, but this time to give thanks for the safety and delivery of my daughter. Thank you."
67,inamoment.wav," I love numbers. I love how straightforward and direct they are. I love how one plus one is always equals to two, and how two plus two without a doubt equals to four. And so when it was time for us to decide what we wanted to do in university, I knew for sure that I wanted to work with numbers. So you can imagine my joy when I had about something called actuarial science. LAUGHTER For those of you who do not know what that is, is this really amazing course that has you spending your days doing things like calculus and probability and statistics? It's what insurance companies use to know the mortality rates and tell you how much premium you need to pay. It's what governments use to know what areas to invest. I mean, who wouldn't want to spend the rest of their lives doing that? LAUGHTER But just before I went to university, I was diagnosed with epilepsy. And the doctor told me that I had to make sure I did three things. It ate well, slept well, and never missed my medication. So I'm doing the doctor's advice. I enrolled to do actuarial science at the University of Nairobi. A few years into eight, I was lucky enough to get an internship at an insurance company. I remember my first day there. I had a mismatch suit, but it was a suit nevertheless. And the director's assistant was assigned to show me around. And since we were almost the same age, we quickly clicked and made it a routine to come very early in the morning just to share our dreams and ambitions. A few weeks into the job, the company got a really big business deal, which meant all of us had to chip in. And we spent one Friday afternoon learning how to use this new fancy photocopying machine. On Saturday morning when reported for duty, I got the honorable duty of working with a new photocopying machine. I remember working into the copier room, armed with a rim of papers, and a stack of files that I needed to photocopy. I opened the machine just to make sure it had enough papers as we had been instructed the day before. Then I woke up in the hospital. And the doctor told me that I have something called photosensitive epilepsy. This is a type that is triggered by flashing lights and in my case, with the beam from the photocopying machine. And since I had a known history of epilepsy, the doctor said that there was no need for me to be admitted. And that I should go home and get some rest. So I went home, got some rest, and was looking forward to Monday morning to redeem myself at the workplace. On Monday morning, I went back to the office and the directors assistant told me that I had been given two weeks to get more rest. I was really excited about this, because here I was doing my dream job, and I was working for a company that cared about my health. And so I went home and I did some research on this photosensitive epilepsy, so that I could make sure it never happens in the workplace again. And after the two weeks, I went back to work. And the directors assistant told me that they'd given me two more weeks. This time round, I was as excited as I was before. For some reason, deep within me, this two plus two was not adding up to four. And so in the evening, after a walk hours, I called the directors assistant, and they asked if she had had anything about my case. And after a few minutes of silence, in what was almost like a whisper, she said to me, sitawa, the directors said that we cannot walk with someone like you. This meant that they couldn't walk with someone with a health condition like mine. And after a few more moments of silence, she said that he was thinking of telling the person who introduced me to this insurance company to break the news to me. I can't really recall how that phone conversation ended. I don't know if she hung up fast or if I hung up fast, but I remember basting out into tears. And I cried because of the pain I felt that the director of this insurance company did not have the courage or the integrity to tell me to my face that I didn't have a job anymore, but he kept giving me two and two more weeks off. But most of all, I cried because I didn't ask for this. I just started falling down. And so after a few days of crying, I turned my tears into words and moved those words to a blog. And before I knew it, people living with epilepsy were coming to my blog for inspiration and information and support. And as the numbers grew, I started a hotline and they were able to get prompt support from it. I still love numbers. I love the truth in them. I love the fact that numbers tell us things about people. And from the numbers I have interacted with, I see a future where people like me living with epilepsy increase in the workplace. I also see a future where people working with us know that they can work with us and they can touch us and they'll not get this thing that we have. And this thing that we have only puts us down for a little while and after that we are able to rise up to contribute to the wellbeing of this amazing world that we live in."
68,theinterview.wav," So, I graduated at a very good time, chosen 2008, the peak of recession. And I was a student with Visa and I had one year to find a job or I would be get out sourced or deported back to my country. So, I had no option but to find a job and I tried all the options. I wouldn't try like any place I can get an interview and after lot of hard work I finally got a call for an interview. Now it was really tough because I had to all get dressed up and wear formulas instead of t-shirt and pants instead of jeans. Like I didn't even know how to iron my clothes. So, I decided to buy a new suit for my interview. But it came with a 14-day written policy. So, I had planned that I return it the next day after my interview. So, I wanted to make sure that the interview goes perfectly because I didn't want to screw up my interview. So, I made sure that everything is perfect. Like my interview was here in Boston. So, I learned everything about the football team or the hockey team and the women ice skating team. Like everyone, I made sure. I even googled like how to shake hands like a man. Because I didn't want to leave anything up to anyone. I just want to make sure that everything is perfect and I get the job. So, I went for the interview and there were like four interviews and there were like three, first three interviews was by the colleagues and the fourth interview was the most important interview which was by my future manager. So, I gave all the first three interviews. I talked about weather and football team and everything and I made sure that I impress everyone. And then I went to the fourth interview and by this time I was very confident that I'll get the job and he asked me all the questions. I answered it and he looked very impressed and I was very confident that I have this job. And then he said let's go for a lunch. So, I was like okay, yeah, let's go for a lunch because I know how to use fork and knife. I know how to put handkerchief while sitting. I made sure that I knew everything but as soon as we went there it was a sushi restaurant and I did not learn how to use a chopsticks. I was like how do we use like I've never used chopsticks in my life and he was like a pro. He was eating rice with chopsticks. So, I was like what do I do? I have no time. So, I just decided that I'll just observe him. And he had also brought the HR people and there were like other colleagues as well. So, we were all there for the lunch and I was just observing everyone on how they were using chopsticks. And anytime I get like really tanned stuff, I would always say one Mississippi, two Mississippi and three Mississippi for some reason. Because that always helps me to calm down. And I remember we all got, we all got our lunch. I had tofu and I was only concentrating like from the ball to my mouth. That was, I just want to make sure that nothing falls off the chopsticks. Like I was so concentrated on that that at one point my manager was talking that we had lost three million dollars last quarter. I was like mm-hmm nice. So, I went into like I ate the first tofu. It went directly in my mouth perfectly. Then second one, one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. And one after another I ate and I started gaining confidence. And just when I was at the last tofu, it came here and the chopsticks flipped. And the tofu went up in the air. And the wasabi sauce got detached like the satellite detaches from the rocket. And then the tofu did four summer salts in the air. And it was going to land on the chicken soup where my manager was eating. So, I thought let me take it before it falls there. But by mistake I hit this chicken soup. And it the whole soup fell on its clothes. There was like a complete silence. And then I was like um sorry. And I know I had messed up everything because the next time I was like oh this chopsticks. And I realized that I have now messed up the whole interview. I knew that I had messed up because the rest of the conversation while we were going back to the interview room, anything I said he was like mm-hmm that's all he said every time. So, I knew I had messed up my interview but I wanted to make sure that I don't lose this opportunity because I had got it like after a lot of hard work. So, I wanted to make sure that I don't miss the opportunity. So, while I was waiting in my interview room for like the last interview, he came in the interview room and before he could say anything I was like give me one more opportunity. I will confirm two things. One, I will never have sushi with you again. And second thing I can bring a lot to the table and I can offer a lot of things and he was like okay what can you offer? I was like well I can bring diversity in your group. And all your clients are from India so I can talk to them in my local language and we can really work this out. So, he said we will think about it but you have to give me three dollars and fifty cents. I was like why? He was like well I have to laundry my shirt and my pants and also dry clean it. I was like well I don't have three dollars and fifty cents. He was like well don't worry. Bring it when you come here on your first day of your job."
69,thecurse.wav," So my friend and I are driving around Detroit looking for something to do and this is a problem because my friend Mark is a kind of person who will say to you if you get a tattoo, I'll pay for it. So that means all kinds of things could possibly happen right now and while we're driving we are on eight mile and grass shit those of you who live near Detroit. Note the sound. Yes exactly and we come across a gypsy fortune teller and we decide why not. So we go in the gypsy fortune teller and the gypsy comes out and looks at the two of us and says you go first and she points in Mark and Mark goes first and I'm sitting there and I'm trying to figure out well I should probably have a question. You know I don't want like random information about my life. I don't live the kind of life where I want to know what's going to happen. It's probably best that that just sneaks up on me. Because the stuff so far has been out of control. So I'm sitting there and I think well really the only question I have is am I ever going to find love because right now I'm 28 years old and I'm not in a relationship. I lost my virginity at 26 and yeah because you should say it that because Mormons lose it at 20. Okay so I'm I'm actually destroying the sex bell curve for everybody. So but sitting there I'm like well you know if you're going to do this you probably should be honest. Okay so I'm not really trying to figure out if I'm ever going to find love. That's a really broad thing. I'm trying to figure out the question I have is will Mark ever fall in love with me because let's face that I'm hanging out with him because of that. But anyhow Mark comes out of the door and the gypsy says okay you're next and I stand up and as I'm walking towards the door she locks me in a gaze and says your cursed. Your cursed. This is your cursed to never find love. Your cursed. This is the worst curse I have ever your whole family's curse. This is generation. This I've never seen a curse I haven't gotten in the room yet. I've never seen a curse like this in my life. I get in the room. She still I am floored by the level of curse that's hanging on you. And no cards have moved. No cards have moved. And I'm standing there and I got to tell you I'm pretty excited about this because all these years I thought it was me. I thought it's like I'm 28. I didn't use my virginity to tell us 26. I thought it was too loud, too fat, too black, too whatever. But if I'm just cursed how will you? Yes that means we can fix it. I am obviously a problem in search of a solution. All right here we go. So she starts to talk to me. She's taking the cards down and as the cards go down if anything the curse is going further back and getting worse. So every card that goes down she's just confirming what she's already said. So she looks at me and she says okay your Uber cursed and I can fix it. And I'm like yes. And she says we're going to get some candles together. I'm going to light some incense. I'm going to say some prayers. Nice. I like how you're thinking. And she just starts with this all this stuff off. And she says and I can do all of this for you but it's going to cost you $5,000. Okay now I'm mad. Okay because I'm from Detroit and you are trying to hustle a hustler. All right. We do this game in the D every day. And you think that I'm going to give you $5,000 to lift a curse. I'm going to get right on that. Top of my list of things to do next. So we pay the GF4 to tell her we leave. And as we're driving away I'm thinking to myself yeah but you know like 26 you might really be cursed. You know but I don't have $5,000 so I'm thinking all of this through. And it dawns on me well I'm going to have the only way I can lift this curse is I'm going to do it myself. And the only way to do it myself is I'm going to have to become a witch. Nothing I can do. There's nothing I can do with my options. What are my options. And you can't afford a doctor you have to become a doctor what's your option. If people could afford doctors with empty wouldn't exist what's your option. Right so I'm like fine I'll become a witch. Now here's the thing about me. I don't think that smart people are smarter than me. I think they read a book I didn't read. So this whole thing has got to be in a book right this got to be in the book so I start trying to find information and the first place you go is online right so I've got the Internet I've got the Google right so I'm typing in which craft hex breaking all of that and all this information is coming back but I don't understand it I can't seem to wrap my brain around how this works. So I flash back to college and in college if you don't know something you take a class right you take a course so I'm saying to myself well obviously I just need to find like a witchcraft class like so how I'm in Michigan how hard could that be. So I'm driving around one day after work and this commercial comes on and it says metaphysical bookstore classes wick a one oh clat wick a one oh one classes I'm like perfect but I don't have a pan I can't write it down so I drive over to the building to sign up for wick a one oh one. For those of you who are familiar with the heroes journey there is always an obstacle I'd like to describe to you my first obstacle so I walk in the bookstore and sitting at the counter in this metaphysical bookstore is what I really can only describe him as Satan's valet. Alright this guy has jet black hair that goes to the top of his head to the back of his knees except for an inch of hair from the part here which is silver. Apparently magicians can't use hair dye so he is wearing Benjamin Franklin sunglasses he is wearing what I will refer to as the theory of a sweater because it really wasn't enough yarn in it to be a sweater but he thinks it's a sweater and I'm in no position to argue that. And and this is my favorite touch to everything about him he is drinking what I will later discover is cognac out of a hogwarts mug. Now my family is Baptist right not up here Baptist where people get out of church in less than eight hours but like Georgia Baptist like every day in church Baptist right so I look at this guy and all I can hear are my uncles who are all creatures beginning with the wages of sin is death that is death before you I'm like this is true okay and this guy scares the hell out of me and I'm going to leave and then the voice in my head says I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave and I'm going to leave I say I want to sign for the Wicker-Winter class and Wicker-Winter-One class. As he runs off, grabs a pen, signs me up, and I start taking these classes. I ask him, you know, hey, is there a book I'm supposed to read or anything? And he sort of recommends a few now, you know, few books. Most of them are arcane knowledge that to this day I don't understand. But one book sticks out. And I begin to hang out with the community and I begin to do spell work, right? So the purpose of Wicker, for those of you who don't know one, I'm sure that's probably all of you. The purpose of Wicker is to know thyself. So it's not really about doing magic to change this out here, it's about changing you. That's the purpose. So instead of doing all this magic to make the world accept me, I start doing the work to accept myself. And I'm doing spell work for that. And one of the spell, piece of spell work I do, is to be open to love in all of its forms. No matter what form shows up in, just be open, right? So it just so happens that as I'm working with the community, the author of the book that I, that finally made me understand Wicker, is doing a fundraiser, right? Pagans have fundraisers, okay? Churches have fundraisers, guys who golf have fundraisers, we have fundraisers. But there is a difference between, you know, like a fund raiser, you know, I don't know here in Ann Arbor where people have money. And a pagan fund raiser in Downriver, Michigan. Probably the thing that you need to know is that nobody in this room at this fundraiser has any money. But you don't know that because they're all dressed like Gandalf the Grey. They're wearing so much stuff that you're like, well, obviously you have some cash to buy that. I mean, that tree you're walking around with alone, it's got to be like 100 bucks. Also, these are not, these are all my friends, I love them. Some of them are here tonight. But they're not the most financially savvy folks in the world. These are the kind of people who won't pay a gas bill because they need a new hat. So fundraisers can be challenging in the pagan world. But I'm at this fundraiser and I'm sitting at a table and I look out and this woman is walking across the room. And all the lights seem to go out and all the people in the room seem to disappear. And all I can see is her. Now, this could have been a romantic moment except that voice in the back of my head says, you're black, you're a woman, you're a pagan. Are you sure you're going to just add lesbian to that list? Like, you know, like this isn't, you know, like this isn't Pokemon, you ain't got to catch them all. You know? But I keep looking at her and I'm thinking, yeah, I'm probably going to have to add lesbian to that list. And I'm also thinking this conversation about being gay with this conversation with my mother is going to top the pagan conversation by a country mile. Easy, easy. So this incredible woman sits down next to me and starts flirting with me, which I'm shocked by. I flirt back. I'm super shocked by that. My flirting is working. I'm terrified by that. And the whole time that I'm sort of talking to her but trying to talk myself out of talking to her, the spell work that I've been doing pops up. And the spell work was be open to love in all its forms. So you might as well be open. So 10 years later, I'm not too anything. I am married to that woman that walked across the room. At no point did it cost me $5,000. And believe me when I tell you, I can lift one hell of a curse. Thank you. Thank you."
70,onapproachtopluto.wav," So it was the 4th of July this past summer, and I was really looking forward to a day off. I had been working super hard for a long time. I was working on NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, and there was always something to do. But I was going to take the 4th of July off. So I slept in, I read a little, later I decided to check email. Never check email on a day off. There was a message there from the mission operations manager, Alice Bowman. My eye immediately went to it. It said that the spacecraft had gone safe. That's like the worst possible thing that could happen. I couldn't believe what I saw in the message. I'm like, how could this have happened? It was going to be a simple day, a day off. You see, I had been working on this project for more than a decade. In 2004, I had relocated my family from California to Boulder, Colorado to work on this mission. This was a life, once in a lifetime opportunity. I'm an astronomer, and I had been spending decades looking at Pluto through ground-based telescopes. And it's just this fuzzy dot. You can't make out any surface details. We kept looking through these ground-based telescopes, even through the Hubble Space Telescope. It's still just a fuzzy dot, because Pluto is really far away. So we move, my husband starts telecommuting for his job. We move our three-year-old, our five-year-old, we're here, we're settled. All we need to do is build a spacecraft, test it, launch it, and fly it three billion miles to Pluto. So we built a small spacecraft about the size of a baby grand piano. And we launched it on the largest rocket we could get in Atlas V. It's about 20 stories tall. So you've got a small rocket, or a small spacecraft, big rocket. And what you get is the fastest spacecraft ever launched. It's going at 34,000 miles per hour. To put that in perspective, when the Apollo astronauts went to the moon, it took over three days. For new horizons, the spacecraft passed the moon in just nine hours. We were flying. It's an unmanned spacecraft, so I mean that figuratively. There's no one on it. So we've got nine and a half years to go from Earth to Pluto. So we've got a lot of time on our hands. We think about what data we're going to collect, how we're going to do it, and we make contingency plans. So plans in case something goes wrong. We considered more than 200 different scenarios. What do we do if this breaks? What do we do if that goes wrong? We had this huge binder full of contingencies. So I find myself on the 4th of July. It's just 10 days before our closest approach to Pluto. You see, we can't stop an orbit Pluto. We don't have enough fuel to slow ourselves down, because we're going really fast. So we can't stop. We just have to go right by and take the best images we can as we're flying past. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity. We have to get it right at this time. And the spacecraft has gone safe. It's called home, which is basically saying, help me. I'm broken. So I rush over to the Mission Operations Center. I settle in in the situation room. This is a conference room. Right outside the Mission Operations Center, you can see the operations people through the window. But they like to keep the scientists a little separated, so we don't get in the way. So I settle in. I'm sitting with my colleagues. We're starting to get information back. And interestingly, I'm starting to feel calm. That sick feeling in the pit of my stomach is relaxing. Because I've been working with these people for more than a decade. And everyone knows what they need to do. We all know what our responsibilities are and how to make this work. You see, we have three days to get the spacecraft back in working order. By July 7th, we have to have it up and ready to start executing those commands so that when it fly back flies by Pluto, we get the data that we've been waiting more than a decade for. So we start to get information back. But it takes a while. It takes the signal four and a half hours to travel from Earth out to the spacecraft. And then it takes another four and a half hours for it to come back. So we can hear what the spacecraft had to say. So it's like a really slow conversation. Imagine you say hi to someone. Then you go watch three football games. And you come back and they say hi. So that's the kind of data rates we're getting. We start to find out won't we're wrong? We'd overtaxed the computer on the spacecraft. Remember, this computer is 10 years old. My guess is that none of you use a spacecraft, a computer that's 10 years old, on a daily basis for really important things. But we planned for that because we sent two computers. So we overtaxed the prime computer. And before it crashed, it started up the backup computer and said call home. OK, good. It's working kind of. So now we're on the backup computer. We kind of know what went wrong. And we've got a big question in front of us. Do we try and get back on the prime computer, or do we fly through closest approach on our relatively untested backup computer? You see, the whole time we've been flying across the solar system, we'd never turned on the backup computer. The last time it was on was on the ground when we were testing it a decade ago. So we make the logical decision to switch over to the prime computer. But we're worried because if we really messed it up, it may not start. And we're getting short on time. We've been in the situation room for three days. People are taking naps in the conference room. There are pizza, many orders of pizza coming in, being eaten. So we don't have a lot of time left. We send up the commands to switch over back to the prime computer. And then we wait. And we wait nine hours. I find myself nine hours later back in the situation room, looking through the glass window with operations, people, hoping this works. When I see people start cheering and erupting and cheers and excited. And I hear Alice Bowman's voice over the intercom. We are back on the prime computer. Everybody was so elated. I let out this huge sigh of relief. I didn't even realize I had been holding my breath. It was amazing. We managed to get the spacecraft back in working order. Everything was going right. And we had four hours to spare. It was outstanding. We start going back to our main sequence and we start getting data. It was absolutely stunning. Views of Pluto, like we had never seen before. I couldn't believe the beauty and the details that were awaiting us at Pluto. We would have never expected the unusual terrain we've seen. We saw a heart-shaped glacier made out of nitrogen and carbon monoxide ises. At the edge of the glacier, there's huge mountains. Mountains as tall as the Rocky Mountains made out of water ice. Pluto has a large moon named Sharon. On that moon, there's a deep canyon, deeper than the Grand Canyon. All of these wonders awaited us as I had previously looked at Pluto through our ground-based telescopes. They were there and I just couldn't see it. It was miraculous. We had accomplished our objective of transforming Pluto from a fuzzy point of light to a complex, rich, geologic world. Thank you."
71,thetiniestbouquet.wav," So I'm sure a lot of you think that your dad's make dating worse than the intrinsic nightmare that it already is. But Yaldon grew up in Texas. Okay, my dad is a couple inches taller than I am, but probably one of the most intimidating men on the planet. He's an ex-Air Force Vietnam vet who became a mechanic because he was much better with his hands than he was with his heart. He's allergic to feelings. So my dad started running romantic interference very early in my life. I remember a night when I was five or six and we were having dinner at the closeted gay music minister's house. And I was down the hall playing with his son and we were playing Kiss Tag, which I'm sure you can imagine, is Tag with Kissing. As soon as my dad found out he came to the back room, he grabbed me by my ear and drugged me onto the hallway and said, you ain't never to play that game again. And I said, why dad? He said, because Kissing is where babies come from. Okay, like all good Texans, my dad didn't let me date until I was 16 years old and I clearly remember the day that this rule was set. I was about 13. This really cute boy at school had asked me to meet him at the mall, swoon. And I had to ask my dad for permission, but he was changing the oil on the suburban. So I went out to find him and I had to ask his knees, you know, because he was under the car. And so I kicked the ground and asked him if I could go to the mall and he didn't respond. There was just some grunting and then he shimmyed out from under the car, grabbed that pan of dirty oil and started walking right up back to the house. And I tottered after him, like maybe he didn't hear me. And he gets to the porch where this like bright cluster of daffodils had just bloomed. He locks eyes with me and pours that dirty oil all over those flowers. And he says, absolutely not. Not to your 16. Okay, and I was crushed like imagining this boy at Spencer's with another girl. So I didn't have my first real date until junior year of high school was homecoming dance. And I was like, okay, this is it. I'm going to have my first kiss tonight. We're going to get married this summer after graduation. We'll start having Christian babies. It's the way that God wants it. And of course it had a poccaliptic rain to the night before this dance. And so our crappy front yard was just a mud swamp. And my dad's solution was to crisscross some two by fours between the sidewalk and the porch. And so this poor boy had to balance beam it to our front door. And then once he got in, it was just four walls of guns and dead shit. And my dad sat him down and he put tube socks on both of his hands. Instead, I don't want these coming off all night. Pulse a shotgun off the wall. Open it, real casual like. And ask the boy to look down the back of the barrel to see if it was clean. Needless to say, I did not get kissed that night. I was home by 9.30 and I cried myself to sleep. I was like, I am never going to get married. That's it. Like this is it. In the 20 years since that night, I have brought literally two humans home to meet my father. The first one might as well not have had a name because he was only ever referred to as noodle arms. This includes all in-person interactions. The second one hadn't even been in our house for five minutes when my dad sat him down and handed him a grenade. He had emptied the powder from the grenade, but of course the boy did not know that. He sat down next to him, pulled the pin and said, got a couple questions for you. Things didn't work out with those boys. I didn't blame my dad, obviously, but he wasn't helping. So I stopped bringing people home. And it got to the point where I didn't even want to talk to my dad about who I was dating or anything personal going on in my life. And my last breakup was awful. It was like one of those eviscerating ones that make you lose sleep and wait and hope and mankind. And I called my mom, sobbing, told her about it. She said, do you want to talk to your dad? I was like, no way. And the next day I get a call from the front office. And they said, I have a package from 1-800 flowers. And I said, that's weird. And I went to get it and it was from my dad. He had Googled his way to my work address and had this adorable little bouquet of multi-colored tulips sent to my school. And the card said, just wanted to cheer you up, just thinking of you. Miss you, want to kiss you. And it was all in one run-on sentence. And I'm an English teacher. And it was the smallest cheapest bouquet I have ever received. But as far as I know, my father has never sent flowers to anyone. Not mom, not grandma, no one. And it was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen."
72,notontheusualtour.wav," So, I went into politics for the same reason most people do. Ambition, self-righteousness, and a desire to help others. If you've spent any time in Washington, you know that the desire to help others is optional. When I had a pretty good run of it, I was a speech writer for then-Senator Hillary Clinton, and a then a speech writer in the White House for President Obama. You can picture it. I was a gay liberal wearing a Charles Darwin t-shirt, riding my electric scooter through the gates of the White House to write speeches on climate change and universal health care. So like a right-wing worst-case scenario. Now there's a question you're asked more than any other when you're a presidential speech writer. And the question is, what happens when you disagree with the speeches? Now the truth is, I'm incredibly proud of the work I got to do at the White House. Some of the proudest moments of my life are working in some small part on the campaign to repeal Don't Ask Don't Tell, past the Affordable Care Act, working on the technical pressing remarks on things like the financial crisis at a moment of real peril for the country. But the truth is, you don't always agree. And that is especially true when you are a gay speech writer, writing speeches for people who do not support gay marriage. I wrote speeches at a time in which the democratic position was basically, love what you're saying, you're making a ton of sense. No thank you. But please, please don't hesitate to check back in because this is so stupid. And the truth is, I liked working on these speeches too. For the longest time, being a Democrat was defined by what we were for, not what we were against, repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell, ending employment discrimination. But the truth is, over time, as it became less politically necessary, it became more awkward to work on these speeches. Now, there were times where I sought out this awkwardness. I was working on a speech on gay rights for Senator Clinton and I stood up from my desk, walked into her office, knocked on the door. She was there, minding her own business, and I said, I just want you to know that I'm gay. She looked at me, confused, and said, oh, Jonathan, I knew months ago. But the truth is, I like the awkwardness, and by the way, there's a noise that people make when they tell a gay person that we're not going to support gay marriage. It's like, oh, look how easily we're, look, you know that we wouldn't. But just right now, we're. But I didn't just like the awkwardness because I'm smug, though I am. I liked it because I really couldn't deny that I was part of this, that for all the ways in which I understood, for all the ways in which I even supported the decision that I recognized the larger good, writing those speeches meant I couldn't ignore doing this thing. And I especially couldn't ignore it when two of my best friends in the world, Steve and Justin, asked me to perform their wedding. Now I was incredibly touched when they asked me to be there to be to officiate because I love them. I love attention. So it was perfect. And they were going to have the ceremony in West Virginia now. West Virginia didn't turn out to be the last state to recognize same sex marriage. Would you give me a resure they weren't going to be the first? So it turned out that they were going to need a licensed officiant to do it in the district of Columbia. And I said, well, why have me just do the ceremony? Why don't I go through the process and become a minister in the district of Columbia, which I did? So we went for West Virginia and I performed the ceremony and standing there on this beautiful hill with these two people who were in love. And by the way, these two guys are boy scouts. They were literally eagle scouts. They recited the scouts oath at their wedding. It was the most wholesome thing you could ever imagine. And not only that, in their marriage becoming the thing they did with the love they felt for one another, they not only created a safe and stable place for themselves, but they created a place that welcomed all of those around them that were ricocheting across DC. And that's why marriage exists. For the longest time, I think that Democrats and those of us that supported Democrats, I think we all understood this compromise. And I think that we also like to ignore it. We like to ignore the fact that we were making this moral sacrifice because we cared about so many things, we cared about health care, we cared about the environment, we cared about all these important issues. But there were moments where, especially for me, in that position where you could just no longer could ignore that despite the best intentions, you were part of something you really didn't believe was right. And that for all the ways in which you understood, there was a part of you that knew that you weren't doing the right thing, that you were doing things to go along to get along. That you were doing things because you were ambition, because you didn't want to rock the boat. And the truth is, for all the ways in which you understood, didn't mean it wasn't just a bit embarrassing, a bit humiliating. But then of course, I remembered that I worked at the White House and I can give tours any time I want. So Steve and Justin and I walked through the double doors into the ground floor of the West Wing, past the situation room, down the hall, past the offices of the National Security Council, up the stairs by the cabinet room, the Oval Office, through the doors and the colonnade that connect the offices of the West Wing through the, to the, uh, stately rooms of the residents. We turned right down the stone path that jetted into the Rose Garden. And then I said, Steve, do you take Justin to be your lawfully wedded husband? And Justin, do you take Steve? Now we were very nervous. They were nervous because they were getting married. I was nervous because I snuck into my boss's house to perform a wedding against his wishes in his backyard. I mean, you can say what you will about the first same sex marriage to take place at the White House, at the very least it was quite rude. In fact, I was so nervous that, uh, in my, in going through it, I said, I now pronounce you man and what, and catching myself, we laughed and I fixed it and said husbands. They kissed modestly. It was very nice. And then I filed the paperwork, the only real evidence that this took place because I had to list the address. 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. You know, when I think about the question, do you always agree with the speeches? What I've come to realize is it's actually a bigger question than that. It's a question that really is about, you know, do you believe in politics? And I do, you know, I, I ultimately think that those sacrifices are worth it, that being part of something noble and great, an enterprise of, of the magnitude of what you get to do in that building is worth it even when you don't always agree. But I will tell you that I will always be proud of a speech I, I do very much agree with. I now pronounce you husbands."
73,goldiethegoldfish.wav," For the past 25 years, I have participated in the annual endurance sport known as the Family Vacation. And our family has been pretty adventurous. We've gone to Egypt and Rome. We've gone to Botswana. Last year we hiked in Northern Canada for three days. In 2007, we rented an RV and we decided to take all our kids and go cross country. On the second morning, when my husband overestimated the height of the underpass at the fast food restaurant and knocked off part of the top of the RV, including the air conditioning unit, we decided we weren't RV people. So the next year we decided we're going to play it safe, set the bar, whoa. And we get in our minivan and we decided to go to seaside, Florida. Now packing a minivan with three kids at that time, eight, 12, and 16 years old is really an undervalued skill, in my opinion. We had to pack everything. They needed drawing pads, paper. They wanted Nintendo Game Boys. They wanted the portable DVD player. They wanted pillows and blankets. I needed my crocheting. My husband needed a whole pile of CDs from the demos he had made all year so he could check out what he had done and the pitches he could make. We packed it all and that does not even include the floats that I packed because they charge you an arm and a leg. If you wait to the beach to buy your floats, we had to pack fishing gear. We had to pack goggles and fins and beach chairs. We needed to pack all the staples for the week and the snacks. That doesn't even start with the clothing. So we overpacked and we started out on a blistering global warming peak day in July in Nashville, Tennessee, to drive eight hours south to where it's hotter and more human. We made the eight hour drive and for us what was a world record of 12 hours. As we needed to stop for every individual child's bathroom time and we had to stop halfway through Alabama for the sign that said fresh Georgia peaches. And at the border when you get to Alabama and Florida it says the world's best burgers and who can't stop for that. So it's after dark when we get there and the first thing I'm allowed is my favorite thing, the arts and crafts. And I lay them on the table, the two older kids are rolling their eyes and think, oh, another year of us have to do beach tie dyes, art journals, hook pot holders. In my all time favorite, the beach trarium. And we're putting all that and laying it all out. My husband is popping two beers just as he's getting ready to start dinner after he drives all day. The kids are laughing. And despite all the stress, I promise you. The first day of vacation is one of my favorites. I love everybody laughing. I can hear boys laughing and I'm like, are they wrestling or are they going to beat each other up? It's always that way with kids. It's just this activity and energy. I loved it. Next morning I get up and we're getting ready for the second leg of this endurance sport which is get everything to the beach. And so I decide to take a few minutes before that and go out to the porch that's facing the beach and just take a few minutes of peace and the sun is rising in bands of lavender and it's so beautiful. It makes my jaw clinch. My jaw always clinches when I see something really stunningly beautiful like yellow and purple wildflowers together. And so I was sitting back there in my phone rings and it's the house sitter who says everything is fine. She's taking care of the pets and stuff. Everything is fine except in the middle of the night. Goldie died. Goldie was the goldfish and it was too late to ask for an autopsy. But I was very suspicious because we'd only been gone 26 hours but she had already flushed her down the toilet. I kind of laughed because I was the clempt a little bit. And I just got off the phone and thanked her for all she was doing and I went in to tell my family and I said, hey everybody and I look around. Everybody's just lounging around the living room in various forms of repose and they look like what my mom used to call lolly gaggers. You know the older two just watching TV. The youngest one trying to put together a star wars Lego set and my husband with his feet hanging over the side of the couch strumming the guitar and I say, hey you guys Goldie died. And everybody's like, okay, nobody missed a beat on the guitar. Nobody turned down the TV and my youngest son Moses who was actually Goldie's owner who had named her that amazing name looks at me and goes, hey can we get a dog now? And nobody was trying to be mean or insensitive. It was a goldfish. But I just took a minute and I decided to walk back to the porch and just think about why I was having some feelings when I was feeling my feelings and walked back out there and decided to walk on the beach and within about five minutes I'm crying and I cannot figure out why. It's ridiculous. Now Moses and I had won Goldie at the Tennessee State Fair the fall before when he had thrown ping pong balls into a small bowl and he was so proud. It only cost us ten dollars worth the freaking ping pong balls to win this fish that's worth less than a dollar on the open market. But he was proud and the carnival hawker put her in a bag tied the top, this plastic bag and he walked around with her all night and I knew she was a survivor. And she even did well in the container. She was in a confinement in a vase until we could get her a proper home so we could spend another fifty dollars on a tank that was a underwater beautiful wonder world. I mean it had pebbles, it had plastic beach trees, it had an underwater bridge that she could go in and out so she could have some quiet time. And Moses and I in our crazy lives and our busy noisy lives of our family when Goldie came and graced our lives we started this routine at night of reading and feeding her and snuggling in the bed and watching her grow. And she was growing this beautiful translucent tail and we bought a special light so we kind of glow at night and because it was magical to him it felt magical to me. So I'm walking by the ocean and I am now openly weeping and I am laughing at how ridiculous it is. But I'm walking by an ocean with a million fish in it and we have actually brought tools of destruction for those fish and I'm crying over a goldfish and it feels more ridiculous because I felt like my whole life I had handled grief so well. I mean my first memory is my father dying when I'm five years old by a drunk driver. And my mom died when she was 30 when I was 30 of a terminal brain illness my sister died of an aneurysm not to mention the fact that I'm an episcopal priest I've presided at probably a hundred funerals. I'm the founder and president of Thistle Farms a community of women survivors. I have walked. Thank you all thank you thank you I have walked with women through some horrific stories. And so the fact that I'm being undone by goldfish is surprising to me. But in all honesty my tears are now down my face and hitting the sand so I decide to sit down and I decide to take a moment and look out onto the tide where it's the closest thing I know to where the eternal and the temporal meet. I sit there and I realize that in addition to being the only person in the whole wide world that's ever going to grieve that goldfish. And so I am also grieving the fact that she was what helped me hang on to being a mom to young kids. That was it. I no longer had to cut my kids' food up. I didn't have to carry them in the grocery store when they would get tired. And pretty soon I wasn't going to get to pack a bunch of crafts and all the stuff they wanted for vacations. Goldie was it. This wasn't going to want to buy another fish and snuggle me at night and read and look at her amazing tale. With the death of Goldie I was saying goodbye to that. And so I gave myself over for a minute to the great gift of grief which says when we truly love something it opens those spaces and us and we're allowed to weep. We give ourselves that permission. Goldie reminded me in such a graceful way and so less dramatically than all the other traumas in this world. How childhoods pass so quickly about how we don't get to choose what we grieve, our hearts will grieve what they will. And that grieving it is this beautiful way of saying thank you I loved you. And so I sat there and wept for a minute and gave thanks. As I was really saying to my children thank you. I loved being a mom to you and I miss it and I'm so proud of you. Rest in peace Goldie."
74,cautioneating.wav," First, I'm going to take you back to the way back machine. We're going to go back to the 80s. A period of time when the early 80s, when I was spending a couple of years asking anybody I had ever met for money for my unopened restaurant and going through the process of raising the money, doing the legal stuff, finding an architect, getting it designed, and going through the building process. It took 18 months or so. So during this period of time, I met and got to be very acquainted with the project architect who we'll call Joe. And Joe and I kind of had this courtship that happened over blueprints and the building department. And our sort of fog of romance was so sweet that many people fell into it. I wanted to give you an idea if you've ever gone down to the building department and try to get plans passed. We managed to get plans for a restaurant passed over the counter. I don't know how we did that. I can tell nobody is here ever built anything in Los Angeles. That was like a kin to, you know, the resurrection. Seriously, amazing. So he thought he had met this really cool Los Angelina check from Silver Lake kind of hippie who cooked all the time at home and had like a great sense of humor, was really relaxed. And then, you know, that period of time of raising money and building came to an end. You know, there was one day where actually it was done. It was all done. There was nothing else to do. And, you know, my partner and I looked at each other and were like, well, I guess, you know, the only thing we can do is open the door. So then I became this other person. I became this insane person. But I understand how people become like that. I was working a hundred plus hours a week in the kitchen. I was coming home every night, progressively more pissed off the more weeks went by. I would come home really, really late, stinking a fish with, you know, a new constellation of burns. And, you know, it would get to the point where he would have to tell me to go park my truck. And he wasn't talking about my car out in the street. It was like, if you want me to talk to you, you really have to park your at a tunable truck. Which also became progressively harder to do. So time went on the same rhythm. You just fall into this rhythm where you wake up late, you go into work, you work really hard. It was really a very successful restaurant. It had tiny number of seats. It was a huge amount of pressure. And, you know, after you finally finish working the line, you have to clean up, you have to order all your goods, you have to massage your everybody's ego, make sure all the equipment is working for the next day. You have to think about what you need to do for long-range planning. Like, you need to train the staff, you need to teach them about wine varietals and pasta varieties. And, you know, you have to call the red cross and have them come and teach everybody how to do the Heimlich maneuver and CPR. And I realized that the romance was starting to slip away from me, that this other person that I had become was sort of not very nice to live with. And we were getting to be like ships passing in the night. He would get up early in the morning, he'd go to his really amazing architecture job. And I would come home really late at night and then I would stay up even later because it took so long to come down from that sort of, you know, adrenaline high, working the line. So I knew we needed to have a date. So, you know, after refusing to be pinned down forever, I finally said, okay, okay, we'll go out. We'll go out, I promise we'll go out. We'll go to an actual restaurant, we'll make a reservation. We'll go out. I mean, the thought of going to a restaurant. Can I tell you like, uh, horrible. But, you know, I got ready. Who's the 80s? I had big hair, bigger than this. Big earrings, big shoulder pads. I was ready. And we had a reservation at a lovely restaurant that we really liked in the neighborhood on Third Street called Sophie, SOFI. A Greek restaurant owned by a very lovely couple who seemed to host a lot of chefs would go there after work or on nights off. They were great. And it was an interesting restaurant because the way you approached it was very non-luss Angeles-like. You parked your car, you were on the sidewalk, but to get into the restaurant, you had to go through this concrete corridor that sort of dumped out into a beautiful little brick patio and then the door to the restaurant. So we go, we sit down, we're seated, we're drinking wine, we're having a really, really good time. And I order one of my favorite dishes. Greek salad called hodiatiki. We're going to pause here for a recipe. Hodiatiki is made of... Hodiatiki is made of really good fresh tomatoes which in the 80s were in very short supply. I'm usually cut into like one and a half inch chunks or into wedges. You have thinly sliced red onion, you have some sliced cucumber, bell peppers, of course really good feta cheese, which then probably wasn't that good. And covered with olive oil and maybe a little hint of red wine vinegar and a copious amount of dried oregano. Just like perfect for me, so happy. And we're sitting making Google eyes at each other, laughing, talking, drinking, eating. The recipe I have since learned for choking. So I felt it. I felt this piece of tomato go into my windpipe. Now you know all the times that you've thought you were choking but you really just like coughed a little bit and moved from your windpipe to your soft gas and then you chewed on it and you swallowed it. Or... Or you're like coughing a little bit and somebody you know comes up to you and gives you a couple of hard thwacks on the back and you're like thank you, thank you. I needed that. That isn't really what choking is. Choking is when on the inside of your body you hear a sound that's like a cork being put into a bottle and you know that the minute that happens that you are the walking dead. So this was before there was the international symbol for choking. And so what did I do? Did I turn to any of the lovely tables around me and gesticulate wildly? Did I turn to Joe and say? Because I couldn't talk because there was no breath. No, what I did was run out of the restaurant, run down that concrete corridor out onto the sidewalk where I was completely alone. My heart was racing like it had never raced before and I you know was much thinner so I didn't have that reason. So my heart is racing. I'm sweating like a pig and I'm thinking to myself I'm actually going to die from a piece of tomato that was cut in a very unfortunate size which has, I mean to this day becomes sort of an obsession with me now. But then Joe comes running down the corridor. I see him arrive my savior but he has no idea what to do. He is very quietly hysterical. I can he's trying to hold it together but I could see his face. He's really he's he knows I'm choking. He doesn't know what to do but because we had taken that red cross class I knew what to do and this was like at the beginning of the Heimlich maneuver miracle. Now oh my god we've saved hundreds of people in Angelo but so I positioned him behind me and I I molded his hands to like do the abdominal thrusts which compresses your diaphragm and causes the propulsive wind in to expel the foreign object. And the first time he does it nothing happens and I think to myself oh this is just not good. And then he says to me your lips are blue. And so I like my my my legs I just remember like oh but then he did it again and this time just as I heard that sound of it entry my windpipe it sounded like don't pairing you on it had just been cork and it the piece of tomato flew I mean flew in this beautiful arc like 15 or 20 feet and hit a park car. And and then I you know puked delicately. And I and I looked at Joe and he was trembling I was trembling we both had flops wet all over us and then we sort of held hands we walked back down that concrete corridor went into the restaurant we sat down and we finished our meal."
75,beneaththemushroomcloud.wav," My grandfather was Harry Truman. And he is known for a great many things, but the one that always comes up, and the one that usually comes up first, is his decision to use atomic weapons against Japan in 1945. My grandfather never spoke to me about that decision. To be fair, I probably didn't give him a chance. You had to be careful around my grandfather. He would give you a history lesson if he could catch you. I learned about Hiroshima and Nagasaki the same way that all of you did from a history book. And my history book did not have a whole lot. It has to cover a lot. So there was a page, a page and a half. There was explanation. There were casualty figures. There was usually a picture of the mushroom cloud. But there wasn't much or anything at all about what happened to the people on the ground. In 1994, three things happened. I was 37 years old. The first thing was that I agreed to join the board of the Harry S. Truman Library in Independence, Missouri. I had not up to that point taken an active role in my grandfather's legacy. I was married. I had started a family. I was working as a newspaper reporter in Wilmington, North Carolina. But my mother, Margaret Truman, had gotten older and had felt that it was time to pass the baton to have the next generation come in. At about this time, my editor on the newspaper said there is a Japanese exchange student in town. She is going to give a demonstration of Ikebana, Japanese flower arranging. Go out, interview her. I need a story for tomorrow's paper. So I met the young woman and her host, who was an older guy who lived in town. I knew him. And at the end of the interview, her host said to me, I told her who your grandfather was. And she smiled and bowed and said, that's very nice. And I said, thanks. And in the next second, he said to her, tell him about your grandfather. And she looked very uncomfortable. She stared at the floor. And when she didn't answer, he said to me, her grandfather was killed in Hiroshima. I said to her the only thing that I think one human being can say to another, in a case like that, I said, I am so sorry. I am so sorry you lost your grandfather. But what she did surprised me. She looked me in the eyes and smiled and said, thank you. And in that brief instant, I thought that both of us wanted to walk over there and knock her host on his butt for putting us in that situation. The third thing that happened actually happened three days earlier. My mother, Margaret Truman, had agreed to give the keynote address at ceremonies in Wilmington, marking the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings at Normandy. And as we were all leaving the theater at the end of the show, big crowd of us going out, two older men were trying to get my mother's attention. They were reaching for her sleeve. And they missed. My mother was whisked out the door with the crowd, put in a car, and driven back to her hotel. My wife and I were behind her. So we turned to these two gentlemen and asked if there's anything we could do. And we noticed that both of them had tears in their eyes. And we said, what's wrong? And they said, nothing. Nothing. We just wanted to thank her. If it hadn't been for her father dropping that bomb, neither one of us would be alive. They were Pacific War veterans. Five years later, we are now living in Chicago, and moved to Chicago. And my son, Wesley, who is now 25 years old, he was 10 years old at the time. He came home from school with a book, Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes. For those of you who don't know the story, Sadako Sasaki was a real little girl. She lived in Hiroshima. She was two years old when the bomb exploded. She and her family survived, but Sadako was diagnosed nine years later with radiation-induced leukemia. To help her treatment, she followed a Japanese tradition that says, if you fold 1,000 origami paper cranes, you are granted a wish or a long life or health. There are several interpretations. The most popular version of this story has her folding 644 cranes. Her family says that she actually folded closer to 1,500. Spiritually, it was a great help to her, but sadly, she died of leukemia in October of 1955. There is a monument to Sadako and to all the children killed, wounded, sickened by the bomb that stands in Hiroshima's piece Memorial Park to this day. Thinking of the Japanese exchange student and thinking of the two Pacific War veterans, I told Wesley that I was glad he was reading this book because he needed to understand both his great grandfather's decision, but also understand what that cost the Japanese people. His teacher didn't stop with the book. She taught them Japanese history. She taught them culture. She taught them geography. I came home one afternoon and found my living room coffee table covered with sushi and green tea and Wesley standing next to it wearing a kimono. He brought all of Japan into our lives. He brought the country, the culture, everything into our household. And I mentioned this over the next four or five years. I mentioned this to a couple of different Japanese journalists who were working on stories on the anniversaries of the bombings. And one day my phone rang. It was from a call from Japan. It was Masahiro Sasaki, Sudako's older brother, himself a survivor of Hiroshima. And he said he'd heard that I had read his sister's story, and he would like to meet me someday. We met in New York in 2010, where Masahiro and his son, Yuji, were donating one of Sudako's last folded cranes to the World Trade Center Memorial as a gesture of healing. And during that meeting, Yuji Sasaki produced a small box and took out of a tiny paper crane and put it in my palm. And he said, that's the last one Sudako folded before she died. Will you come to Hiroshima and Nagasaki for the memorial ceremonies? And I said, yes. We arrived in Tokyo in 2012, in August of 2012. And the train ride from Narata Airport into Tokyo proper is about an hour. And my family and I took my wife and my two sons, Wesley and Gates. We all had our faces shoved up against the windows of the train. Because all this time, the last two years, we had been soaking up Japan. We had been soaking up the culture, the food. We had been watching one Miyazaki movie after another. And here it all was on the outside of the train. Villages, houses, rice fields, mountains, forests of bamboo, we were in Japan. We were there for a very somber purpose, but we loved being there. We had sushi and sake and went to bed happy that night. And the next morning, I had my first interview with NHK, the nation's largest television network. And the young lady who interviewed me started off with a couple of intro questions. She said, how was your flight? How do you like Tokyo? And the third question was, are you here to apologize? And I said, with respect, no. And she said, well, then why did you bother coming? And all of the advanced publicity for this trip had been positive. Japanese reporters had come to my home in Chicago and interviewed me and turned in upbeat stories. This looked like it was going to be very well accepted. So this question caught me flat-footed. I stammered through it. I said, it's not about apology. It's about reconciliation. It's about honoring the dead and listening to the living. And she didn't like any answer I gave her. She rephrased the question over and over and over again, digging for a different answer. And it finally got so uncomfortable that my interpreter almost stopped the interview. And that afternoon, on the train to Hiroshima, I thought, God, what have I done? What have I gotten myself into? I am not a representative of the United States. I am a private citizen. I cannot apologize for my grandfather. I cannot apologize for my country. I've held Sadako's crane in one hand. And I have held, in my other hand, the hands of men who fought a horrible and bloody war. What's going to happen when I keep saying, no, how is this whole thing just going to be a bust? And I worried about it all night in Hiroshima. I practiced that answer over and over again. So at least I wouldn't fumble through it. At least I would be succinct. I didn't sleep much. We got up the next morning and went into the peace park. And there, around the base of Sadako statue, around the children's peace memorial, were 30 or 40 reporters, cameras, microphones, and I thought, here we go. And I braced myself to just, you know, to spend the next week answering apology questions. And out of the middle of this throng came Masahiro Sasaki. And he walked up to me. I hadn't seen him for two years since the first time we met. And he walked up to me and he smiled. And he put his arms around me and hugged me. And my worries vanished because we were going to do this together. We did everything together after that. And Masahiro answered the apology question for me. He always got in front of that. And what he essentially said was, if we ask them for an apology for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, they can ask us for one for Pearl Harbor. And where do we go from there? The survivors themselves, and we interviewed Masahiro and I sat down with more than two dozen survivors. And just let them tell me their stories. And it's hard to describe, and it's hard to imagine what they went through. Burnt, the skin stripped from their arms and legs, their houses destroyed. The children trapped in the rubble burning to death because they couldn't get them out. People vanished in an instant vaporized. Yet none of them asked me for an apology. None of them came to me in anger. None came with recrimination. They only asked that I listen. Sakue Shimohira, who survived Nagasaki, said, I think the basic idea of peace is to have some understanding of other people's pain. She and the other survivors asked only that I listen to them and I tell their stories to you, to anyone else who will listen, so that every one of us understands what it's like to live through a nuclear explosion, so that hopefully we never, ever do this to each other again."
76,bluehope.wav," I was knocked over by a wave when I was three years old, and the ocean cut my attention, and it has held my attention ever since. But it wasn't just the ocean, all that water and the joy of rocking around in the waves, its life in the ocean. So it was natural that I become a biologist. And over the years, studying biology, I think I was ready as a botanist, actually, at Duke University on my way to earning a PhD. When I was asked if I would be willing to go for six weeks to the Indian Ocean as a botanist, an ocean botanist at that, because my specialty has been and is still seaweed, those lovely plants, the photosynthesizers in the ocean. So it was only after I actually got on board and arrived in Kenya, Mombasa, a newspaper, writer, interviewed the science team. And we poured our hearts out. There were 12 of us who were really charged with exploring the Indian Ocean from the deck of a National Science Foundation-funded ship, the Anton Brun. And this was my first experience with newspaper interviews. Nobody expected the headlines the next day. There they were, Sylvia Salesaway with 70 men. This subtitle but she expects no problems. I'm not sure what kind of problems they were expecting, but we did have a really big problem. All of us, we were on a little boat on the top of the ocean, the ocean average depth is two and a half miles and life all the way, maximum depth, seven miles. And we had to assist us with exploring the ocean. Hooks, nets, dredges, troughs, the things that you can lower from the deck of a ship into the unknown depths below. Imagine trying to understand New York City. Imagine aliens coming here up in the sky with clouds obscuring the view below, lowering hooks, dragging through the streets, taking little bites out of New York City and trying to figure out what's going on here anyway, based on the little fragments that they would be able to examine. Well, that's the way it is with the ocean even today. Only about 10% of the ocean has been seen at all and it dominates the planet. That's where 97% of Earth's water is and of course water is the key to life. I'll fast forward a bit. 1969 when the first footprints were being put on the moon. I was at Harvard at the time and saw a notice on the board asking for those scientists who wish to participate in an experiment living underwater as aquanauts. Aquanauts, I mean astronauts were big news so the appeal of being able to use the ocean as a laboratory by actually living in the ocean, diving and staying underwater, getting to know life by being in the middle of the action. I mean people do it on the land all the time. If you want to understand a desert, you go to the desert. If you want to understand life in the forest, you go explore the forest and you can stay there for long periods of time if you choose to do so. You have to go into the ocean living 50 feet underwater to be able to go outside and really use the ocean as your laboratory. What a concept. So I put in my application never expecting what happened next. No one expected women to apply. There were no women astronauts in 1969, 1970, not until the mid-1980s. All those footprints on the moon are made by guys. It's okay. They're people too, you know. The head of the program, James Miller, had to decide because I wasn't the only woman who applied and those who did had qualifications that were, you know, they were okay on a par with the men who applied. And he said he thought about it, really considered it because there were some objections. But he said, well, half the fish are female. Half the dolphins, half the whales, I guess we couldn't put up with a few women. Well, remember this is 1970 when this program finally came into action. Hanky panky on the reef. Oh, what would people think if you have men and women living together underwater? So they made all women's team, which made headlines. It was a little off-putting when you think about it, that people were so excited about the thought that there would be a woman's team. No real attention made to all of the nine teams of just guys and one team of women, but the women got all the press. They wanted to know, oh, did you wear lipstick? Did you have a hair dryer? But mainly, mainly. They wanted to know what it was like to live underwater. And this idea of women living underwater seemed to lay a lot of fires because we got a lot of attention. It took her tape parade down state street. We had a luncheon at the White House after our two weeks stay underwater. People just wanted to know what's it like. I was faced with microphones, not just one, oh, belly of microphones. So I did try to share the view. Wrote for the National Geographic, told about how these beautiful silver, carp, tarpon came and swam with a full moon, silhoueting them. And that even in the dark, there was light because there by luminescence, swimming at night around our underwater home was like swimming through stars. And here's the thing. I got to know the fish. I got to know them as individuals. And there were five angel fish that came from different places after they slept, got up really early. I got up really early to watch them. They'd gather together. And they'd pal around the reef all day. And at night they'd go their separate ways. Little butterfly fish would team up. Well, they apparently do stick together, mate for life. By two and two and two, you'd see these little butterfly fish. You know, like some people they mate for life. Go figure. And there was a big, beautiful, green, more a eel. We couldn't resist. We were called in puff, like puff the magic dragon. He was there at night when we would make our excursions. It was just a transformation for me because I'd seen fish before diving in and out, up and down. You casually see grouper and snapper. But this time I got to meet that grouper, that snapper, that eel, that parrotfish, those parrotfish that gathered together. I'd also seen plenty of fish swimming with lemon slices and butter. Haven't you all. But the idea of seeing them with new eyes and realizing that everyone is different, I could recognize them. Their faces are different. Their spots were different. Their attitudes were different. Call it personality, if you will. Some were shy, some were aggressive. But they were all part of this immense system, a coral reef, where I was a visitor and getting to know what life was about. Well, all right. Fast forward to 2012. I had a chance to go back to the same place that underwater laboratory had been removed, but I was reflecting on before I took the plunge to see what it was like after 42 years. What had happened to the world in 42 years? What had happened to me? I had the opportunity to dive in many places around the world. I actually helped foster new technologies to be able to explore the ocean, to stay underwater, enjoy the gift of time, by helping to build design and build little submarines. So simple to drive that even a scientist can do it. Living proof. 1970 to 2012. It's an assignment, shift in attitude, in scientific discoveries. It just reflects on how far humankind has come in just a few decades. We have taken the ocean for granted, thinking, oh, we can use the ocean as a place to put things. We don't want close to where we are. And the ocean is so big, so vast, we can take out of it whatever we want, no problem. The ocean, the ocean is too big to fail. We thought in 1970. Now we know. And there I was, perched on the edge of a little boat, looking at the place where the tech-tight laboratory had been, ready to take the plunge. And I wondered, wonder if that eel is still here? Because fish can live long time. Sharks can be as old as any of us or older. Older than your grandparents, some of them. Was that big grouper? Oh, I love that. Big Nassau grouper. Where was he? I mean, I knew where he used to be. Armed with these hoops, I took the plunge. And it was a ghost town. I suppose if this had been my first dive, if I hadn't known what it was like 42 years before, I would have thought, oh, this is kind of beautiful. The border is clear. There are some of these big, lumpy, bolder carls. There's kind of still there. None of those branching staghorn and elkhorn carls that they used to write about and talk about. But, you know, I see fish. Well, you know, little damsel fish, a few, one little tiny grouper. But basically, it had been stripped of most of the creatures that I had come to know and use as part of my understanding, the baseline of understanding about what the ocean should be, what carl reefs should be, these thriving, vibrant communities of life. A lot of bad news it would seem, but here's the good news. Not far from where the TechTite laboratory was situated and where I found this disappointing scene, there's a place called Buck Island that in 1961 was protected. My president Kennedy and ever since associated with a national park on the land, the national park extended into the sea. Diving there is like diving 50 years ago. It's amazing. Protection works. This is the centennial of national parks. Some say it's the best idea America ever had. Well, it's certainly a good idea. Now, blue parks are beginning to catch on around the world. Nations, including our nation, the United States is beginning to step up and not only embrace more of the land, but with blue parks. As of this time last year, 1% of the ocean had protection for the creatures that live there, where even the fish and the lobsters and clams and oysters were safe. Now we have 2%. Still not very much if you think that the ocean is the blue heart of the planet that makes our lives possible, but hits the trend in the right direction. We doubled it in a year. There's plenty of reason for hope. What is going to be our story, your story? Those of us who are around early in the 21st century, we have a choice. We can protect nature. We can save the natural world and nature can save us. Now is the time. Let's do it."
77,canplanetearthfeedtenbillionpeoplepart3.wav," The Luddites' moonshot. For as long as wizards and profits have been arguing about feeding the world, wizards have charged that profit-style agriculture simply cannot produce enough food for tomorrow. In the past twenty years, scores of research teams have appraised the relative contributions of industrial and organic agriculture. These inquiries in turn have been gathered together and assessed, a procedure that is fraught with difficulty. Researchers use different definitions of organic, compare different kinds of farms, and include different costs in their analyses. Nonetheless, every attempt to combine and compare data that I know of has shown that profit-style farms yield fewer calories per acre than do wizard-style farms, sometimes by a little, sometimes by quite a lot. The implications are obvious, wizard-say, if farmers must grow twice as much food to feed the ten billion, following the ecosystem-conserving rules of Sir Albert Howard ties their hands. Profits smite their brows at this logic. To their minds, evaluating farm systems wholly in terms of calories per acre is folly. It doesn't include the sort of costs identified by vote. Visualizer runoff, watershed degradation, soil erosion and compaction, and pesticide and antibiotic overuse. It doesn't account for the destruction of rural communities. It doesn't consider whether the food is tasty and nutritious. Wizards respond that C4 rice will use less fertilizer and water to produce every calorie. It will be better for the environment than conventional crops. Just like trying to put out fires you started by dousing them with less gasoline, the profits say, just eat less meat. To wizard the idea of making farms diverse in a way that mimics natural ecosystems is hooy. Only hyper-intensive industrial scale agriculture using superproductive genetically modified crops can feed tomorrow's world. Productivity, the profits reply, we have moon shots of our own. And in fact, they do. Wheat, rice, maize, oats, barley, rye and the other common cereals are annuals which need to be planted anew every year. By contrast, the wild grasses that used to fill the prairie are perennials, plants that come back summer after summer for as long as a decade. Because perennial grasses build up root systems that reach deep into the ground, they hold on to soil better and are less dependent on surface rainwater and nutrients, that is, irrigation and artificial fertilizer than annual grasses. Many of them are also more disease resistant, not needing to build up new roots every spring, perennials emerge from the soil earlier and faster than annuals. And because they don't die in the winter, they keep photosynthesizing in the fall when annuals stop. Effectively, they have a longer growing season. They produce food year after year with much less plowing caused erosion. They could be just as productive as green revolution style grain, profits say, but without ruining land, sucking up scarce water or requiring heavy doses of polluting energy intensive fertilizer. Echoing Boerloggs program in Mexico, the Roedale Institute, the country's oldest organization that researches organic agriculture, gathered 250 samples of intermediate wheatgrass in opyrum intermedium in the late 1980s. A perennial cousin to bread wheat, wheatgrass was introduced to the Western Hemisphere from Asia in the 1930s as fodder for farm animals. Working with U.S. Department of Agriculture researchers, the Roedale Institute's Peggy Wagner, a pioneering plant breeder and agricultural researcher, planted samples, measured their yields, and cross-bred the best performers in an attempt to make a commercially viable perennial. Wagner and the Roedale Institute passed the baton in 2002 to the land institute in Salina, Kansas, a non-profit agricultural research center dedicated to replacing conventional agriculture with processes akin to those that occur in natural ecosystems. A land institute collaborating with other researchers has been developing wheatgrass ever since. It has even given its new variety of intermediate wheatgrass, a trade name, Kernza. Like C4 rice, wheatgrass may not fulfill its originator's hopes. Wheatgrass kernels are one-quarter the size of wheat kernels, sometimes smaller, and have a thicker layer of bran. Unlike wheat, wheatgrass grows into a dark, dense mass of foliage that covers the field. The thick layer of vegetation protects the soil and keeps out weeds, but it also reduces the amount of grain that the plant produces. To make wheatgrass useful to farmers, readers will have to increase kernel size, alter the plant's architecture, and improve its bread-making qualities. The work has been slow. Because wheatgrass is a perennial, it must be evaluated over years rather than a single season. The land institute hopes to have field-ready, bread-worthy wheatgrass with kernels that are twice their current size, if still half the size of weeds, in the 2020s, though nothing is guaranteed. Domesticating wheatgrass is the long game. Other plant breeders have been trying for a shortcut, creating a hybrid of bread-weed and wheatgrass, hoping to marry the farmers' large plentiful grain and the latter's disease resistance and perennial life cycle. The two species produce viable offspring just often enough that biologists in North America, Germany, and the Soviet Union tried unsuccessfully for decades in the mid-1900s to breed useful hybrids. Bolstered by developments in biology, the land institute, together with researchers in the Pacific Northwest and Australia, began a new at the turn of this century. When I visited Stephen S. Jones of Washington State University, he and his colleagues had just suggested a scientific name for the newly developed and tested hybrid, Tritipyram Asii, the species name honors the pioneering serial geneticist Hannah Asii. Much work remains, Jones told me that he hoped bread from T. Asii would be ready for my daughter's children. African and Latin American researchers scratch their heads when they hear about these projects. Reading perennial grains is the hard way for profits to raise harvests, says Edvige Botony, a researcher at the permanent Interstate Committee for drought control in the Sahel in Burkina Faso. Botony gave a lot of thought to the problem of feeding people from low-quality land while traveling along the edge of the Sahara. One part of the answer, she told me, would be to emulate the farms that flourish in tropical places such as Nigeria and Brazil. Whereas farmers in the temperate zones focus on cereals, tropical growers focus on tubers and trees, both of which are generally more productive than cereals. Consider Kisava, a big tuber also known as Maniak Mogo and Yuka. The eleventh most important crop in the world in terms of production, it is grown in wide swaths of Africa, Asia and Latin America. The edible part grows underground. No matter how big the tuber, the plant will never fall over. On a per acre basis Kisava harvests far outstrip those of wheat and other cereals. The comparison is unfair because Kisava tubers contain more water than wheat kernels. But even when this is taken into account, Kisava produces many more calories per acre than wheat. The potato is a northern equivalent. The average 2016 U.S. potato yield was 43,700 pounds per acre, more than ten times the equivalent figure for wheat. I don't know why this alternative is not considered, Botony said. Although Kisava is unfamiliar to many cultures, introducing it seems easier than breeding entirely new species. Much the same is true for tree crops. A mature Macintosh apple tree might grow 350 to 550 pounds of apples a year. Orchard growers commonly plant 200 to 250 trees per acre. In good years this can work out to 35 to 65 tons of fruit per acre. The equivalent figure for wheat, by contrast, is about a ton and a half. As with Kisava and potatoes, apples contain more water than wheat does, but the caloric yield per acre is still higher. Even papayas and bananas are more productive than wheat, so are some nuts like chestnuts. Apples, chestnuts and papayas cannot make crusty baguettes, crunchy tortillas, or cloud-light chiffon cakes. But most grain today is destined for highly processed substances like animal feed, breakfast cereal, sweet syrups, and ethanol. And tree and tuber crops can be readily deployed for those. Am I arguing that farmers around the world should replace their plots of wheat rice and maize with fields of Kisava, potato and sweet potato and orchards of bananas, apples, and chestnuts? No. The argument is rather that profits have multiple ways to meet tomorrow's needs. These alternative paths are difficult, but so is the wizard's path exemplified in C4 rice. The greatest obstacle for profits is something else. Labor The right way to live. Since the end of the Second World War, most national governments have intentionally directed labor away from agriculture. Communist China was long an exception. The goal was to consolidate and mechanize farms, which would increase harvests and reduce costs, especially for labor. Farm workers no longer needed would move to the cities where they could get better paying jobs in factories. In the Borlogi and Ideal, both the remaining farm owners and the factory workers would earn more. The former by growing more and better crops, the latter by obtaining better paying jobs in industry. The nation as a whole would benefit. Increased exports from industry and agriculture, cheaper food in the cities, a plentiful labor supply. There were downsides, cities in developing nations acquired entire slums full of displaced families, and in many areas, including most of the developed world, the countryside was emptied, exactly what Borlogi and intended, as part of the goal of freeing agriculture workers to pursue their dreams. In the United States, the proportion of the workforce employed in agriculture went from 21.5 percent in 1930 to 1.9 percent in 2000. The number of farms fell by almost two-thirds. The average size of the surviving farms increased to compensate for the smaller number. Meanwhile, states around the world established networks of tax incentives, loan plans, training programs, and direct subsidies to help big farmers acquire large-scale farm machinery, stock up on chemicals, and grow certain government-favored crops for export. Because these systems remain in effect, Votian farmers are swimming against the tide. To Votians, the best agriculture takes care of the soil first and foremost, a goal that entails smaller patches of multiple crops, difficult to accomplish when concentrating on the mass production of a single crop. Truly extending agriculture that does this would require bringing back at least some of the people whose parents and grandparents left the countryside. Providing these workers with a decent living would drive up costs. Some labor-sparing mechanization is possible, but no small farmer I have spoken with thinks that it would be possible to shrink the labor force to the level seen in big industrial operations. The whole system can grow only with a wall-to-wall rewrite of the legal system that encourages the use of labor. Such large shifts in social arrangements are not easily accomplished. And here is the origin of the decades-long dispute between wizards and profits. Although the argument is couched in terms of calories per acre and ecosystem conservation, the disagreement at bottom is about the nature of agriculture, and with it the best form of society. To Borlaugians farming is a kind of useful drudgery that should be eased and reduced as much as possible to maximize individual liberty. To Votians, agriculture is about maintaining a set of communities, ecological and human, that have cradled life since the first agricultural revolution 10,000 plus years ago. It can be drudgery, but it is also work that reinforces the human connection to the earth. The two arguments are like skew lines, not on the same plane. My daughter is 19 now, a sophomore in college. In 2050 she will be middle-aged. It will be up to her generation to set up the institutions, laws and customs that will provide for basic human needs in the world of 10 billion. Every generation decides the future, but the choice is made by my children's generation will resonate for as long as demographers can foresee. Wizard or profit? The choice will be less about what this generation thinks is feasible than what it thinks is good."

79,singlewomanseekingmanwich.wav," I almost gave up on dating when a sandwich rejected me. I got a message on O.K.Cupid that said, what's shake and bacon? And the only profile pictures were of actual sandwiches. Delicious looking sandwiches, but sandwiches nonetheless. Since I was feeling hungry and lonely, I decided to reply. A lot of bready puns ensued. The bacon egg and cheese sandwich told me he needed me. And I told him I hoped I could rise to the occasion. He told me I was on a roll, and assured me that my jokes weren't stale. He then said I was baking him crazy and asked me to be his bagel. I wrote, I'd love to be your bagel. Then I never heard from him again. Maybe I was too eager and shouldn't have used two exclamation points. The sad thing, yes, sadder than corresponding with a sandwich, is that I was actually disappointed. Was I too witty or not witty enough? Perhaps I shouldn't have used the word love, even though it was disguised as loaf. But then I reminded myself that I was rejected by a sandwich. I ended an eight-year relationship in 2012. The last time I spoke with my former boyfriend, a year after we broke up, I inadvertently quoted Taylor Swift. When he asked how long our break was going to last, I said, we are never, ever getting back together. Feeling empowered from channeling Miss Swift, I created an online dating profile. That was three years ago. Since then, I've been out with countless guys. Had more than one date with some, but no more than five dates with any. Granted, I'm not a great flirt. My idea of flirty banter is sending someone the clue to a crossword I can't solve. I've tried to play it cool, but that may come across as cold. I've tried being honest. The last guy I went out with asked me on a fourth date and then disappeared. Reason dictated that he did not die in a horrific crash, but rather changed his mind about me. Even so, I texted him a couple of weeks later to clarify. The essence of my message was, I liked you and you hurt my feelings. What gifts? Which makes me question if I am 40 years old or 14? His response was vague. Something about being in Canada, getting distracted and dropping the ball. I should have known better than to ask. The reality is that if someone unexpectedly goes out of town, has to work late, get sick, you probably will never hear from him again. Despite the fact that he says he'll get in touch when he's back in the country out of jail, emerged from his coma. Everyone says you have to be happy with yourself before you can find happiness with someone else. I find that notion extremely frustrating. I am happy enough. I have a good job, great friends, and live in New York City. But I am not going to say the loneliness isn't palpable. That I don't wake up in the middle of the night in a state of panic, wondering if I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life. This does not inspire the happiness that I am supposed to embody before I find a partner. In panic attacks, I have continued to put myself out there, taking the advice that I often dull out to my single friends. All it takes is one. This is not to be confused with the one, because I don't believe in soulmates, which is pretty remarkable considering the number of romantic comedies I've seen, approximately all of them. By all it takes is one, I mean you only need to find one person. I met Jim at Bar-Rise in Park Slope. It was early fall and warm enough to sit outside. I found him at a picnic table in the backyard where it was fairly dark. We chatted about work. Then we talked about where we grew up. I mentioned that I'm from Los Angeles and he asked about my ethnicity. I told him that in New York everyone assumes I'm Jewish. My dad is, but my mom is not. Jim cocked his head and stared at my nose. Well, it's a little bit of a hook. Excuse me? Your nose. It's like a little bit of a hook, but not too beaky. It was broken when I was little, but I declined the nose job that a lot of girls in L.A. were probably offered. When I'm uncomfortable, the valley girl and me comes out and I end every sentence in a question. It's like totally awesome. Jim didn't seem to notice. He said that it was cool. I'm comfortable with my nose and that it suited me. I think this was supposed to be a compliment. He then went on to say, but my teeth aren't great. I go to the dentist, but they're rotting from the outside in and there's nothing they can do about it. The words are rotting from the outside in, hung in the air. I was struck that he was so matter-of-fact about it. He said that his teeth are really thin and that everyone in his family has thin teeth. I sat there nodding and smiling and trying to get a decent look at his teeth, but it was too dark. When we went inside to pay the bill, he smiled in the mirror behind the bar and in the light, I could see that his teeth did look well. Grayish. He turned to me and said, I'm a pretty good-looking guy, right? I told him I admired his confidence. When I tell people this story, they are typically offended on my behalf. One friend said she would have walked out after the nose comment. I was more surprised than offended and I don't think he meant it to be hurtful. First dates can be awkward. They're basically job interviews with alcohol. In fact, one date seemed exactly like a job interview. I was out with a guy who works in advertising, as I do, and all he wanted to talk about was the cost of full-page ads and magazines. People say and do weird stuff on first dates. Another guy didn't take off his clip-in bike shoes. Between his gate and the clicking of his shoes, it sounded as if a horse were approaching every time he walked across the hardwood floor from the bar. After at the bellhouse in Brooklyn, and after his second beer, he laid down across the couch where he was sitting and stayed like that for a while, with his bike shoes propped up on the arm of the couch. Then he put drops in his eyes. When he sat back up, the drops made it look as if there were tears rolling down his face. I asked if everything was okay, and he looked at me as if I were the crazy one. A short time later, I was out with a lawyer, and after a couple of drinks, I had my hand on his knee and the words, I always get what I want, came out of my mouth. It's as if I were acting in a play or trying on a new version of myself, since my usual version didn't seem to be having much luck. I'm fortunate the lawyer didn't sue me for ridiculousness. Some say the definition of insanity is repeating the same behavior over and over, and expecting a different outcome. While dating does make me feel crazy at times, one messaging with a sandwich, for instance, I keep at it in hopes that one day the outcome will be different. At the same time, I also try hard to accept that it may never happen for me. I tell myself that I don't need a partner to lead a happy and fulfilling life. Then one morning, I'm on the queue train, across from a cute couple who look hipsterish in a non-annoying, an ironic way. I imagine that he is in a band, and that she does something cool and creative. He says something funny to her and she laughs, then puts her head on a shoulder. When they get up to leave, he holds her hand, and they just look so stinking happy. I want to cry, feeling creepy, for staring at these strangers, and also envious that they seem to have what I want. I get off the train at Union Square and give myself a little pep talk on the walk to my office. I won't give up on dating, at least not now. And I'll just have to hope that Mr. Bacon Egg and Cheese wasn't the sandwich that got away."
80,eyespy.wav," I grew up in Providence, Rhode Island, and for my entire childhood, we were never more than 20 miles away from the core of our universe, the Kennedys. We were Irish, they were Irish, we were Catholic, they were Catholic, they were family. We were like the relatives that they never got to see, but we knew, you know, they're busy, and we knew that they loved us. So anything that was happening to them was also happening to us. So their tragedy, plus our own tragedy, was a lot. So this one Thanksgiving after dinner and a family fight at Grandma's house, we were in the car and we're driving home, and the radio was playing this 10th anniversary of the JFK assassination, and I'm sitting in the back seat and I start to cry. And my sister Erin says, hey dad, Michaela's crying. And my father pulls that car right over to the shoulder of I-95. He stops it, he turns around and he looks at us. And with tears in his own eyes, he says, don't you ever be ashamed to cry for that man. So my parents grew up near Newport and they got married in the same exact church as church is Jack and Jackie, same Mary's. And my father gave exact replica jewelry to my mother that was replications of the jewelry that Jack gave to Jackie. And every Saturday night after mass, my family would be in the living room and we'd be happily ever aftering to the original soundtrack of Camelot. And every year during the 70s, my four aunts would take me and my two cousins on their dream vacation. A rented beach house in Hyannis on the very cove sharing beachfront with the Kennedy compound. Every day for an entire week, my aunt Pat would roll a persistors hair. My aunts would apply sunscreen to the back of their necks, the backs of the hands, and the tops of their feet. And then they would drag their beach chairs down to the beach and they would set them up perfectly. Not facing the water, not into the sun for tanning, but perfectly for spying on the Kennedys. They would sit there all day in the broiling sun with high powered binoculars and keep it constant surveillance. And every year they'd have the same exact conversations. Usually around mid-morning, the first sighting would be made usually by my aunt Pat. She'd be up. They got rose out. Walking. Ethel looks drawn. And then about an hour later, my aunt Gert would say, how old is rose now? And Aunt Momo would make the calculations. Well, let's see. Jack died in 63 when she was 74. And Rose's birthday was two weeks last Thursday. And Joe died in 69, making her a widow at 81. So 85. And then they'd break for lunch. So after lobster and drawn butter and hosing us down, they'd all hustle back to their posts and they'd watch. And every now and then there'd be something they didn't know. Hey, who's that? Who's that? So they'd draw out the family tree in the sand. They'd analyze it. They'd come up with a profile and they'd crack the code. It's one of Bobby's. Now any mention of Bobby would always bring up the inevitable. Oh, I just prayed to God. They don't tell poor senile Rose about Bobby. It'll break her. So then the long afternoon stretch would end with the inevitable annual observation. You don't see Jackie much here. And then all of my aunts would drop their binoculars and look at each other meaningfully. Now, all of us meant that no one was paying any attention to me and my cousins in the water. And the summer when we were nine years old, we found something. Now, had an aunt, perhaps in an effort to ease a cramp in her prying neck, just sort of glance towards the water, she might have seen us climbing into this tiny, plastic, half inflated boat. She might have cried out in the alarm at the lack of ores and life-fests. She might have had a conibction fit to see a shove-off and drift into the violent rip tide that would sweep us within five minutes out to the open sea and the Nantucket-bound ferry. But, an aunt didn't, and we did. It all happened so fast that we were swept out and it wasn't until we realized that we could make out the specific features of the ferry passengers that we were really far from sure. We were so far from sure that my aunts were now reduced to four hopping dots. Uh-oh, it was like Gilligan's Island for real. So an aunt land to swell, crashes over our heads, and as soon as the water clears out of our eyes, a powerboat pulls up out of nowhere. And in this powerboat, our David and Michael Kennedy. So David and Michael pull us up into the boat and we are like, oh my god, we are saved by a powerboat. So the powerboat sends us back to shore and we're psyched because we're saved until we start to watch the four hopping dots morph back into our four crazed, livid aunts. We are so going to get it. Now my family under any circumstances has this really weird thing, well, each have their own weird thing, about yelling and getting into huge trouble. Like my aunt Gerr, like she gets so freaked out that all she can do is yell out our addresses. Like, I lean in Kevin, 275 Hooper Street. Michaela, 180 asylum road. I swear to god, I grew up on asylum road. That's very telling piece of my childhood. Or in my aunt Pat would do these things where she would say these things that were like actually kind of nice things, but she'd say them like they were death threats. She'd be like, yeah, I'll save you from drowning. You get on that beach towel and you lie in that sun. Now, or she'd say, I'm going to buy you a birthday present. You eat that cake now. So we knew that this is what was coming. The Kennedy boys didn't. So they were vivaciously tanned and they pulled up to the shoreline and we brace ourselves. Now what happens is our aunts are out of their minds. They're ready to flay us. But when they see us in the same boat as the Kennedys, it's like they don't have the emotional capacity to handle it. They kind of snap. They're kind of like freaking out to yell at us, but they start fake smiling and trying to act all normal. And my aunt Momo, she's like to take some of this Kennedy Esquay of speaking, which is sort of halfway between Katherine Hepburn and the Queen of England. And we're like, looking at them, like, what are you guys doing? And they're smiling to smile, but when they smile at us, it's like you just wait. But they're like, oh, David, oh, Michael, thank you, thank you, thank you. And they're not mad at us for almost drowning. They're mad at us because the Kennedys had to save us. Like, don't those people have enough trouble? Now you? Like as if our almost drowning was yet another Kennedy tragedy. So these poor boys finally pull and pry themselves away from my aunts. They get back on the boat and they're leaving. And my aunt Momo's going, please give all best to your grandmother. Now it's time for our for real punishment, which was that we for the rest of vacation had to stay on the beach because we did not have any respect for the water. So it's a hundred degrees out. And after about a half hour of whining and fighting and like I'm emptying out all the copper tone and kicking sand, we break my aunt Pat's last nerve and she says, all right, you can go in the water, but only up to your knees. So we're happy for a minute until we get in the water and realize how boring up to your niezes. And then we get the great plan of having chicken fights. So we start to have chicken fights, but it's kind of weird because there's only three of us. So, but we're doing the best we can to have a chicken fight like that and like knock each other off into the water so we get fully immersed. And then my uncle Al, who never, ever played with us ever, comes into the water to play chicken fights with us. And he puts his daughter, my cousin Eileen, up on his shoulders. And then I get up on my cousin Kevin's shoulders and we're having chicken fights. And it's like actual family fun for a moment. And we're like, you know, hitting each other, falling in the water. And then I take my foot and I accidentally kick the side of my uncle Al's head really, really hard. And his eyeball pops out of his head, falls into the water and sinks. And he pops out of his head and it sinks. Eileen, Kevin and I are in instant, complete shock. Right this minute, there is still a part of me that is on that beach screaming. It's like, oh my God, we had no idea that he had a fake eye. We didn't know that you could have a fake eye. Why would you have a fake eye? They didn't tell us that you could, that uncle Al had a fake eye because they didn't want his blabbing it to the whole neighborhood. So they didn't tell us. We didn't know. And later on, there was Colombo and Sandy Duncan, but this was way before that. We had no idea. So we're all standing there and it's like so horrible. I can't even like, oh my God. And my cousin's Eileen and Kevin are staring at me with complete hate. Like you broke our dad. And my uncle Al is standing there and he's got the lid open. So you can like see inside the socket where now it's just like skin and the eyeball gone. And like you cannot just say, I'm sorry to someone that you just, so I don't know what to do. And my aunt Pat is hysterically screaming because that eyeball cost top dollar. It was a special magnetized eye so it could keep up with the other one. And now I had just better pray that vacation was over and that they got that deposit back because now they're going to have to buy a brand new top dollar eye. That was not in the budget. So I just didn't know what to do. I was like, my life is over. I am no longer Michaela. I am now Murf's girl who kicked Al's eye out in the cape. And it's awful and everybody's just crying and pointing at me. And now my other aunts are getting in on it like and who's the blame part of the conversation is happening. So I just kind of back off into the water. I'm kind of like going back and like regressing back to like where life has I once knew it had ended. And I just stand there and like I kind of wish I had drowned. And I kind of wish the Kennedys hadn't saved me. And I bent off into the waves and I just I just start like sifting through sand and shells and pebbles and it's totally ridiculous. But like I will never stop looking for this eye. I'm going to look forever. And I keep looking and looking and I'm sifting through and then all of a sudden there is an eyeball in my palm, staring right at me. And so I scream and I drop it back. And it sinks back into the water. But now we know it's possible. So everybody gets back into the water and now we're all sifting through and sifting through and I pray to God for no more future happiness until we find this eye. And I also kind of pray that it not be me that finds it this time. So after like an hour my cousin Kevin finds the eye and he holds it up in triumph and he does not let go. And my uncle Owl takes the eye. He like washes it off and just pups it back in. And then he kind of like tests it and it's like keeping up with the other one so it's working still. And now it's the weirdest thing because now we know it's a fake eye. And now that you know it's a fake eye it's totally looks like a fake eye. And I can't believe that I never noticed it wasn't a fake eye before. So now vacations back on. And so everybody gets back into their beach chairs and they start to settle down to begin telling the story over and over like a million times about what I just did. And I have not really fully reintegrated back into the family yet. I'm kind of standing apart. And I notice that there actually has been like kind of a group of people who have been watching this whole thing. And then I see something that I didn't notice that no one noticed. And that's that two of the Kennedy kids David and Michael had taken a walk on the beach. And I can tell just by the look on their faces that they had stood there and seen the entire episode. But they had been there watching us. Thank you."
81,reachingoutbetweenthebars.wav," Jenny showed up to my welcome home party in Philadelphia. Hundreds attended, but my eyes kept finding their way back to hers. It had been three years since we'd seen each other, the last two of which I spent imprisoned, partly in solitary confinement, in Evan prison and Terran Iran. On that fateful day, more than 26 months earlier, I had been detained with my friends shane bower in Sarashored after we unknowingly hiked over an unmarked border of Iraqi Kurdistan into Iranian Kurdistan. We were all college friends, vacationing in that relatively safe region between work assignments abroad, and the locals had told us about a beautiful waterfall in the mountains that would make for a suitable day hike. Our mistake was continuing past the waterfall to the ridge line for the view, where an armed Iranian border guard spotted us and motioned us down to him. First he took us to his border outpost, and then we were loaded into a car and whisked away. The Iranian authorities ultimately charged us with espionage, which was farcical, given we had little money, no language skills, and no means to sustain ourselves beyond the day hike. We knew we had become political prisoners, our detention reflecting the fraught history between the United States and Iran, a relationship that had soured slowly since the CIA back coup in 1953 and its support of the country's authoritarian king until 1979. For the first few months, before Shane became my cellmate, I was held in solitary confinement. Once we were together, Shane and I needed each other, but also needed space so badly that the relationship became painfully intimate. I was not allowed to interact with other prisoners besides him, and occasionally Sarah, until the Iranian government released us marking the end of my nightmare and hope for a new life. After my welcome home party, Jenny and I went for drinks, and the next morning, she came to my parents' house and woke me up. I felt like I was your girlfriend at the party, she said. I felt the same way I said without hesitation. Shane and I had acted together in our fourth grade play, free to be a family. In seventh grade we played Weechy together in her attic, in middle school we dated, but I didn't have the guts to hold her hand or kiss her at her but mitzvah. A mutual friend called me soon after to tell me that Jenny just wanted to be friends, which we remained through high school. In college in the years that followed, we touched base every so often to see if we were growing closer or drifting apart. Jenny had emailed me the day I was captured to check in, but I never had the chance to respond. Our sporadic rendezvous in our mid-20s replayed in my mind while I was trapped behind fixed cement walls a world away. Nine months into my incarceration, the authorities granted my mother a one time visit. Desperate for information, I asked her about the political negotiations for my release and about our family and friends and I asked her about Jenny. Jenny was in a serious relationship then, but my mother afraid that the truth would upset me, lied and said she didn't know if Jenny was with anyone. Sitting with me in my childhood bedroom, the morning after my party, Jenny explained that she had recently broke up with her boyfriend of a few years. We both knew we needed to take it slowly, she was affected by the break-up and as a medical student in West Virginia, was trying to focus on her studies. I had little memory of the nuances of daily life, let alone the nuances of a love life. I was 29 and had trouble ordering from a menu. I regimented my home life to mimic my prison routines, cutting my nails on Fridays, exercising at 3.45 pm. When my friends saw me after my release, they said I seemed baby-like, raw and skittish. I didn't know if I should return home to Philadelphia, resume my job in rural Oregon or try to rebuild the life I once had in Oakland, California. Jenny and I started writing handwritten letters to each other, which seemed more thoughtful and reflective than email. I imagined she would wax philosophical like she used to when she would send me letters at sleep away camp, but in her first letter, she wrote bluntly, I don't want to have sex until I'm married. I had not had sex for years, but I didn't let it worry me. I wrote back about the struggles with my new found freedom. Free life was vast compared to a tiny cell, but my mind continued to linger in that confined space. It seemed like ghosts of Iranian prison guards were finding me in my free life. At the motor vehicle department, the landlord's office and the bank, where people talked to me the same way they had in Iran. I don't know. You'll have to talk to my boss. He's not in right now. It made me furious. Months after the party, Jenny and I became more serious, though love still didn't quite make sense to me. Hours wasn't at all like the relationships I was used to with my cellmate, the prison guards, or the interrogators. I didn't have to commit to a hunger strike or bang on the cell door to be heard, and this new way of interacting was welcome but more complicated. I took an open-ended visit to West Virginia to write my memoir and to see how it went between us. One night, after writing about how Shane and I bickered over the petty details of our tiny cell, I couldn't fall asleep. I got angry with Jenny for how she looked at me, for the way she sighed in the middle of our conversations, for leaving the bathroom light on. She cried as I carried on, ostensibly talking about my feelings and demanding apologies all the while, remaining oblivious to the fact that I was reliving the pettiness of my imprisoned existence. I didn't stop until she yelled, I'm not Shane. Therapy stirred up questions about whether I was ready for an intimate relationship. Did I need to find my own place in the world before I could be with somebody else? The history between Jenny and me made our reconnections so powerful but how important was our past? Was I simply playing out a middle school fantasy? I visited my grandfather, who had been a psychoanalyst since the 1950s, and he himself had laid on an analyst couch four days a week for six years after fighting in World War II. The first question he asked me was, did you know that you were a rested on my birthday? It pleased him to think of Jenny and me ending up together. After all, he had fought the Germans with his middle school sweeties name, Muriel, my future grandmother, carved into the barrel of his rifle, though they hadn't dated for years. I told him about Jenny, and he told me that a loving relationship can be the most rewarding part of moving on. Jenny gave up her premarital sexual prohibition, and we started to discuss having children. She flew with me to meet my father's relatives, who lived just north of Tel Aviv. Israel started bombarding Gaza while we were there. We prayed for peace at the Western Wall. Painted our faces with dead sea mud and fell deeper in love. On the flight back, Jenny vomited, and I thought it was because of the turbulence and an effort to purge Israeli politics from her system, but she was pregnant. Eight months later, Jenny went into labor in the apartment we were sharing in Philadelphia. She practiced yogic breathing, satin and inflatable pool. Thirty hours later, I caught our son and placed him on her chest. It was July 30th, the day before both my grandfather's birthday and the anniversary of my detention. We gave our son the middle name Azad, which in Farsi, means free. Since my son had taken his place in the world, I could no longer dally in finding mine. We moved to Brooklyn. I began a graduate program to study history. Of all the apartment buildings in New York City, we unknowingly chose to move into the exact one my grandfather had lived in after the war. After years of feeling utterly unsettled, I sensed I was now exactly where I should be. Finding love helped me find my way amid the tangles of history, and it helped Jenny and me secure a place in the world where, like the aptly titled play from our childhood, we were free to be a family."
82,treasureisland.wav," So I have a band called The Coo. And we've been around for 20 something years through a lot of technology and gentrification type changes. And the technology changes one that has really changed our music a lot. These days you can have a studio on your laptop and just be recorded anywhere in your car in the alley wherever. But back in when we started out in the early 90s you had to actually go to a studio and do it analog and these studios cost a lot of money. So we didn't have a lot of money and we always did the midnight to eight shift because nobody wanted that time and that was the cheapest time. We liked it, I liked it because we come out, it'd be morning time, everybody just be waking up and we'd have a new song. And we went to the studio, our studio was actually right in this neighborhood in the tenderloin and we lived in Oakland and so every morning we'd drive across the bridge back home. One morning we were driving back across the bridge, Pam the Funkstriss, the Coo's DJ was driving and I was sitting in the back with some other folks that had been in the studio and we realized we left our keyboard player at the studio. And so we needed to turn around and the only place to turn around on the Bay Bridge is Treasure Island. And at this time Treasure Island wasn't full of condos like it is right now, it was a naval base. So we got off on Treasure Island, made that turn and started heading back up the hill towards the bridge when all of a sudden we hear, woo, woo, woo, and it was the military police stopping us. They stopped us, the cops stopped us and asked us all for our IDs, there were a bunch of us in the car, we all gave them our IDs. They asked Pam for the registration and I say from the back, registrations in the glove compartment. So somebody opens the glove compartment and a waterfall of bullets come down. Let me explain how those bullets got there. So this was Oakland in the early 1990s, Bay Area in the early 1990s and although Oakland was and is kind of known for this media created image of mass black on black violence, what we know is that from CDC's statistics is that actually there was less black on black murder in the early 1990s and there was in the 50s and 60s. And so although many people when they thought of Oakland were scared of being scared of black people basically, that wasn't what I was afraid of. What I was afraid of were white supremacists. Let me explain further this situation. In the late 80s and early 90s white supremacists organizations made outward claims that they were going to take back the Bay Area. There was a lynching in the late 80s at the Lafayette Barth station. There was an Aryan Woodstock in the early 90s in Napa. There were neo-Nazi rallies in Union Square. This was the time when people like Tom Metzger were in national news and David Duke could get elected to office. And places like Ocean Beach were not safe for people of color because you'd get stabbed by racist skinheads. So when the white supremacist organizations like Aryan Nations started putting out lists of rappers they thought should be killed, that they weren't going to kill, but they thought they should end up dead. First when they started putting out these lists, there were rappers like Ice Cube and Chuck D. People who were known for their social justice lyrics. And the cool you could say we were about social justice, we were a radical communist, we still are. And we were a radical communist band with album titles like Kill My Landlord, Genocide and Juice. Song titles like I want to laugh, love, drink, liquor and help the damn revolution come quicker. White supremacists didn't like us. And we ended up on one of those lists. And it's not a good feeling to know that there are crazy people looking at a list of people that should be killed and you are one of them. So we bought guns. We also didn't want to get messed with by the police so we did it all the way legal. We registered them, we went to the shooting range to make sure we knew what we were doing with them. And we transported them legally when we needed to transport them. We that meant carrying it in a lock box while it was unloaded in the trunk of your car. What I didn't realize this morning before I told somebody to open the club compartment was that we had recently been to the shooting range. And there was a box of bullets that were open. And they came raining down like a waterfall. And they seemed to be going in slow motion. And I feel like I thought the longest oh sh** that I could ever think. And in seeming slow motion the cop pulls out his gun and has it two inches from Pam's head and says put your hands up. Everybody put your hands up. Which we do. And with the gun two inches from her head Pam is crying. The cop radios in for backup. And in what seems like seconds four or five jeeps full of MPs come and they jump out of the cars. And they put put put forming a semicircle holding big machine guns. So we're sitting there with our hands up. And these MPs become the chorus the answer to the cops call. So whatever he says they repeat once or twice. So when he says who has the gun they say who has the gun. And I realize that my next words could decide whether we live or die. But I know that I have to answer something. So I think very carefully about the words that I will use. And which order I will say them in as I say in the trunk in a locked box unloaded there exists a gun. It is registered to my name. And so they say get out of the car. Keep your hands up. It's kind of hard to get out of a car with your hands up. But believe me since I know the stakes my hands stay up and I figure out how to get out of the car. And I'm standing outside the car shaking with what seems like dozens of machine guns pointed at me. And dozens of MPs looking for whatever action they're going to see today. And the cop the initial cop opens up the trunk. He sees the lock box. He says where's the key. I show another key opens up the lock box. Still got my hands up. He sees there a gun and a clip which the clip is what the bullets are kept in. And I say with my voice shaking and but just trying to get the sound out. See it's unloaded. It's totally legal. He says. How do I know that this gun is unloaded? And I say well you see the clip right there. You see it's unloaded. He says how do I know there's not one in the chamber. And I say well you could pick it up and open it and look in the chamber. He says I'm not touching your weapon. I don't know where he's going with this. Pick up the gun and show me. I stand there and he says pick up the gun. And then his chorus of MPs say pick up the gun. Pick up the gun. He says again pick up the gun and they say pick up the gun. Pick up the gun. And I notice that one of the MPs has tears coming out of his eyes. All is yelling for me to pick up the gun. And then that mixed tears come out of my eyes. Because this is it. And after a couple more times of him saying pick up the gun I say just take me to jail. Take me to jail. I'm not touching the gun. I'm not touching the gun. Take me to jail. And I see a look maybe it's defeat or something. Maybe it's just contempt in his eyes as he says get in the car. So I get back in the car. And he goes over and conferences with the other MPs. And hands us back our licenses and says look. You all have traffic warrants. So we could be taking you to jail. But as a courtesy we're going to let you go. Because this has just been a misunderstanding of bad situation here. So I don't really want to argue because I just want to get out of here. After the guns are not pointed at us anymore and we're about to take off I ask him why did you stop us? And he says something about well we don't know if there are terrorists you could be terrorists. We don't know what's going on. So we have to stop and check. And I say well if we were some good old boys in a four by four pickup truck with a gun mounted on the back of our windshield. I don't think you would have stopped us. He's like well I don't know about that. We take off pull up towards the hill and leave there with our lives. And every day or so I have to cross that bridge and I see the sign that says treasure island exit. And it reminds me of the time that me doing everything I was supposed to could have got me killed. Thank you."
83,hangtime.wav," I've always been in a adrenaline junkie. I love driving fast in my car. I love zipping through the woods on my snowboard, my skis, and I really love back flipping my BMX bike. What I haven't really experienced was flight. It was something that I'd always been interested in, but I hadn't had a lot of experience with, and specifically helicopter flight. I always thought that was the most awesome craft to pilot, being quick and light and nimble. And when I saw an ad in the westward paper announcing an introductory offer for 30 minutes of sightseeing and 30 minutes of instructional time, I felt like it was speaking directly to me. So I called them up immediately and set my appointment. And for the next few days, I was extremely excited for that day. So when the day came, I got to the office early. I'm never early for anything. But I was early on this day, and I'm walking into the office, and I look over and I see a motorcycle in the shadows. It's really cool looking motorcycle. And I remember thinking, these are my people. So I go in, I sign my name, I go out with the pilot. If you look at the helicopter, we get inside, butterflies are going, I am so pumped. It's time. I'm going to fly this thing. I got my own set of controls. He has his own set of controls. We get our little lap belts on, get our headsets on. And then the pilot points over at this fire extinguisher, and he says, I need you to promise me something. And I'm going to promise you something too. If you are on fire, I promise I will put you out. Okay. So I say back to him, if you are on fire, I promise I'll put you out. He gives me a high five. We started up. The main rotor blade starts spinning, and we just lift off the ground. He just takes us right up, and it's got a glass floor. I'm looking at it. And it's like jumping my bike, but never coming down. We just continue to go up and up. And I am so stoked. We're flying around, and you wouldn't believe just out past the dirt roads. It is like an African savanna, a safari. You just see things that you would never see or realize are just out there past the city. We get up and I see this herd of deer, and it's so beautiful. They're like running because they hear the helicopter, and they're in a big pack, and they're looking over their shoulders, and we're flying above them. And I'm just like, how cool is this? Nobody would ever get to see this. And so then he zips into this little, this empty riverbed, and then just starts gunning it through this riverbed, like 15, 20 feet above the ground. And I'm loving it. There's trees on either side of us, and we're just zipping, winding through it. And I'm just like, this is so cool. I say to him, dude, you need to get an awesome stereo system in this thing, man. You can just rock up. And he looks over at me, and I'm like, yeah, yeah, this is good, right? And I'm just envisioning this. I'm having this whole fantasy in my head. I'm like, I'm going to get one of these someday. I'm going to have my own helicopter. I'm going to tint the windows. I'm going to paint it like a dragonfly. I'm going to put a sweet stereo system in this thing. People are going to be looking up in the air like, hey, there's Brian. Look at him. So I'm just in this fantasy world. Just so stoked. We're just hauling ass around. I love it. And then he comes up out of there and he says, all right, play times over. Business time. Time for you to learn a little bit. Anybody that's going to be a real pilot needs to know this. It's an emergency drill. It's an auto rotation. Basically, I'm going to cut the power. It's like putting your car into neutral, going downhill. Main rotor blade is going to keep spinning, but there's going to be a big drop in altitude at the beginning. You like e-litches, rides, and roller coasters, that kind of stuff. You got a soft stomach, are you pretty tough? I'm good with that. I'm cool. It's OK. OK, cool. Because if you have a problem, just let me know. I'll land and you can hurl. OK, cool. Bases are covered. Let's do this. So sure enough, he kills the power. Woo! We get that 30-foot drop just instantly in altitude. I feel the upward draft of the air. We just kind of come into this soft, slow drift, and I'm getting to feel what he's saying. You can do if you have an emergency landing situation. And then he starts looking at him. He's fidgeting with stuff. He's turning things. He's got a stress look on his face. I'm just like, everything all right? He looks at me with wild eyes. He's like, this is a real thing, man. I can't believe it. I look out. I look down. It's like a model railroad set. These tiny little trees. And my first thought is, we're going to die. We are going to die. I signed up for this. I paid money to die. You've got to be kidding me. And I'm just watching. You were slowly starting to fall towards the earth. And I cannot believe this is happening. I'm just like, this is a bad joke. When's the camera's going to come out? And he's going to smile and say, just kidding. But he doesn't. He's just doing like, esterns and figure eights. And I'm just thinking, I never expected that this would be my last day. And I start having these crazy thoughts. I put in some pictures to get developed. Who's going to ever see those? Who's going to get my car? Like it's parked down there. I just like, I can't believe that this is the day. We're going to die. There's just no other way around it. You don't walk away from a helicopter crash. And so he starts looking like he may be able to land this thing. We're coming down towards the ground. And now my mind starts to shift from we're going to die to we're going to get really worked. We're going to hit the ground and it's going to suck. I'm going to be laying there with a broken back. And it's just like, I wear more pads when I'm riding my bike. I've got a helmet and knee pads. And I've got a little lap belt in this little headset. We're in like a glass box. I'm just like, we're definitely going to get worked. So admit it to yourself. The next hour is going to really suck. And so here we go. We're coming in for a landing. We're coming in about a 10, 12 degree angle. He's doing good. He's got us going about 50 miles an hour straight towards the ground. And he just seals to me. He's like, we're going to hit. And I just did the only thing I thought seemed right. I just shut my eyes. I took a deep breath. I put my arms out in front of my face. And sure enough, we hit the ground. And we just four by four across the prairie. Just like bouncing across the gopher holes. And then the left skid digs into the ground. And it makes a stop instantly. And we just jerk forward. And then the main rotor blade is just going super fast. It hits the ground. And it just cartwheels the whole helicopter. And it smashes and breaks it right off behind our heads. And we come to a stop looking at the sky. And there's just smoke. And I can smell jet fuel. And the flight manuals are all scattered around inside that the cockpit. And I just shoulder the door and jump out. And my feet touch the ground. And I just can't believe it. I'm just like, yes. And I look up. And I'm just like, oh my god, we're just up that high. And now we're here. And I have just like a tiny cut on my pinky. And I'm just astounded that this has just happened. And then I look at the pilot. And he comes around the corner from his side. And he's just like, I am so sorry. Dude, I am so sorry. And I'm just like, thank you. You did it. You landed it. And he's like, I'm so sorry, Brian. And I'm like, thank you. And it goes on and on like this. And I'm just beside myself. I cannot believe it. I'm like, I'm fine. And then he just, he turns into a stress case. His hands are, his heads in his hands. He's just like, oh my god. I am so dead. FAs didn't have to make a full investigation. There's a $9,000 deductible. We just rebuilt the thing. Oh god. We got to go find help. Let's go. So off we go. We just go walk in across the prairie. And I'm just like, applying the sky. Just like, oh wow. This is crazy. Wait till I tell my friends about this one. And he's stressed the whole walk. And then we see a truck come rumbling down the dirt road. We're like, hey, we wave down this truck. We hop over the fence. We flag these guys down. They've got a CB in their truck. They call the paramedics, the cops, literally within minutes. It's like every single emergency vehicle within a tri-state region is coming over the hill. In ambulance, there's fire trucks, cops, four wheelers. Everybody wants to see what's going on. A helicopter crash and people lived. What? So it's crazy. The paramedics insist that I'm in shock and I'm injured. I had to have gotten hurt. I'm just not feeling it yet. Even though I've walked miles to get here, I'm like, I'm fine. I crash on a regular basis on my bike. I'm good. I know what I'm hurt. But they insist on taking me to the hospital and checking me out and giving me an IV of saline. And so I'm laying there and I get interviewed by the news. And my phone is blowing up and it's just an insane day. And I can't believe it. I'm like, it's a dream. I just go home and I'm just like, what? And I'm laying in bed that night. And I'm laying on my back, my head's on my pillow, and I shut my eyes. And I still feel like I'm falling. I still feel like I'm slowly drifting to the earth. And I'm like, I think I'm going to still live boldly. I'm going to still go fast in my car. I'm going to still jump my bike and do crazy stuff. But I don't think I need to learn how to fly a helicopter. Thank you."
84,marryamanwholoveshismother.wav," When Miles and I decided to live together, I asked him if his mother Terry would be upset. We sat at the kitchen table in his apartment near Fort Rucker, Alabama, while the warm fall evening pressed against the sliding glass doors. Miles would graduate from flight school in a few months, and the army would be sending him to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. My job in Tallahassee would be ending at the same time, and the move felt right to both of us. Don't worry about it, he said. He leaned back in his wooden chair and propped a foot against the leg of the table. She'll probably want to send us a housewarming gift. Go ahead and think of something. I thought placements would be nice. Terry came for a visit three weeks after we moved into our tiny rented house on the outskirts of Fort Bragg. She did not bring placements. She was tense and unsettled, the way I remembered her, and she refused to stay in our guest bedroom. She stayed in a hotel across town instead. In our home, Terry was cordial. She cooked dinner, turning out Miles' favorites, like burnt steak stew, meals with a history that reached back to their hometown in Texas. She made the sugar cookies that Miles liked, the kind I could never get right, and she talked about home and church and family. On the second day, after Miles had put on his uniform and left for the base, Terry suggested that we drive to the mall in Raleigh. Spring unfolds slowly in North Carolina, and the air was cool and damp, even as the first daffodils pushed through the wet earth. We climbed into her rental car and drove through Fayetteville, where rotted dendrons bloomed pink against the grey morning. The rain started when we reached the inner state, and Terry launched into the reason for her visit. You know, Brad and I don't approve of you living together, she said, referring to Miles' father. She called it living in sin. Her hands grit the steering wheel, and outside it poured and poured. When he has sex with you, he's disrespecting you. I thought about telling her that he sometimes disrespected me on the couch, once in the kitchen. She talked for an hour and a half without pause, without my input. But when we reached the shopping center, the space between us seemed somehow easier. We spent the afternoon shopping as good friends often will, inspecting sales racks and eating Chinese in the food court. At the makeup counter at Macy's, Terry tried on lavender eyeshadow. That looks nice on you, I said. She smiled shyly into the hand mirror. When the saleswoman asked if she'd like her to wrap it up, Terry nodded. She was strangely tentative about the exchange, as if she weren't used to buying nice things for herself. Later, after the visit, I asked if Brad had liked the new eyeshadow. He didn't notice, she said, coolie. The distance had returned. In the summer, we stopped at Miles's home in the Texas Panhandle on our way to Fort Hood in the central part of the state. His unit would spend nine months training there before heading to Iraq. As we turned off the highway onto their gravel road, a steady wind blew. It stirred the dry grass and ruffled the cows in the pasture. Miles spent his days outside under the big Texas sky. He rode horses and worked the ranch with Brad while I stayed inside with Terry. She showed me how to make her meatloaf and wrote the recipe for her sugar cookies on an index card for me to take to Fort Hood. She talked endlessly, hardly pausing for breath. It was as if she weren't used to having an audience and needed to unload the things she carried in her heart. She talked about Miles. About how long it took to conceive him, about the miscarriages that came after. She numbered her lost babies among her children. She talked about breastfeeding, sleepless nights, and Miles's sweet baby smile. She cornered me once about the move to Texas, but before she could get into the sinful parts, someone interrupted the conversation. Anyway, Miles and I were married in less than a year, and by then the point was moot. In Christmas we were back in the panhandle. The Henderson clan had assembled for the holidays, and they wore a hard drinking, hard partying lot. They gathered at Uncle Rick's Canyon House where the cousins played cards and drink coarsely light while Aunt Minnie chained smokes on the back porch. Terry greeted them each with a stiff hug. She fit oddly into this mix. She was raised to Catholic, and her mother still went to Mass every Sunday. But when she married Brad, a conservative Protestant, she set aside her faith and adopted his. While Brad's family worked church-going folk, none of them approached religion with his hard-line zeal. So while the drinking and cussing and sinning carried on around her, Terry kept herself apart. At one point in the card game, someone asked Miles where his mother had gone. He hooked a thumb over his shoulder toward the back room where the kids watched cartoons. The cousins rolled their eyes and snickered. Miles was the only one not to laugh. On the day Miles was deployed, after we left him at the hangar on the base, Terry came back to our apartment. She helped me pack up our life so I could go home to my family in Florida. Together we boxed the towels and the bed linens, the crock pot, and a TV. We loaded them into Miles' pickup and Terry drove the truck back to Texas, where it would wait for him to come home. When he did come home, it was not the way we expected. Not with an escort and an honor guard and casualty assistance officers. Terry told me that when the notifying soldier came to her door, she wouldn't let him speak. Stop, she said, and held up a hand. Just tell me if my son is alive. No, ma'am, the soldier said. He's not. I couldn't imagine that kind of backbone. I had listened silently through my own notification, then thanked the soldiers as they left. But later, one had all sunk in, this new reality, and the things we do when we lose someone we love. Her reaction felt right. Miles was the best of her. He had her face, her build, her Texas twang. As much as he was to me, he was more to her, more viscerally hers. They shared DNA for God's sake. After the first few months, after the unspeakable sadness of the funeral and learning the horrible details of Miles' death, Terry came to Florida to help me sort through the things sent back from Iraq. There were two black plastic bins filled with Miles' possessions, carefully labeled and organized, still covered with a fine dusting of Iraq he sand. Although they were legally mine, I was next to Ken, after all. It didn't feel right that I should have sole access to them. We sat in my garage with the doors open, while heavy sheets of rain poured down outside, and sifted through Miles' life in the desert. We sorted through his notebooks and office supplies, his rolled socks and army fatigues. We flipped through his CD collection and we paged through his books. And it was all too much, too much to remember, too much life packed into those plastic containers. Terry stopped, and she pulled the t-shirt from the pile. She raised it to her face and breathed deeply, searching for some trace of Miles. She did not know what I knew, for I had already done the same. The army had laundered his clothes before sending them home, and this too was lost. What remained was the space created by Miles' absence, thick and palpable with our grief. Losing a spouse is in no way like losing a child, but all loss is in some way like losing ourselves. In the months after Miles' death, Terry and I struggled to reorient our own lives. And in that search, we found each other. We began to bridge the distance that had been between us, bringing our shared love for Miles into the unknowable middle ground. At the military briefing following his death, we saw photos of the citrus orchard where his helicopter crashed, and we read the final seconds of audio from the in-flight voice recorder. Pull up. Miles had said at the very end. Terry stood behind me during the hardest parts, pressing her small hands into my shoulders. I have heard people say that you should never marry a man who does not love his mother. I was lucky. Miles loved his mother fiercely. He loved me too. In losing him, Terry and I have not divvied up his love as we have his other things. We have discovered that there is more than enough to share."
85,firetestforlove.wav," I remember it was a Thursday night and it was about midnight and I went into the kitchen to take my drugs which I've been taking for many many years, probably 14 years for low and behold depression and its little partner obsessive compulsive disorder and just as I was tapping them into my palm my fiancee of the time sort of darted by me and darted downstairs into the basement and I said honey where are you going? and he said I'm going to my lab because he's a chemist and he has a lab he had I should say a lab in the basement where he made his drugs while I took my drugs so he went downstairs to the basement and I tapped the four 80 milligrams of pro-second into my palm and it took them with water and just as I was probably downing about the last one I heard from the basement this blood curdling scream and I am actually a person even though I like I look like you know with a furl and everything like I look like I'm fairly sheltered I'm a person who's heard a fair number of screams in her life I'm a therapist and I'm also a veteran of mental hospital so I've heard a lot of screams this one was definitely was a scream to top all screams and I couldn't I seriously could not imagine what this could be the only thing I could think was that someone had somehow climbed in the basement window and was murdering my fiance although that seemed unlikely because the basement window was so small but in any case I ran downstairs really really fast and I long open the door to his lab and he was standing there and he was just ringed in fire he had I should say really long beautiful strawberry blonde hair and that was the thing that I remember the most was that it was just you know like this Medusa like flames around his head in all his whole body was just fringed with fire and I stood there and I know that this this happened really fast but in my mind this moment slowed down and I stood there just for a second but it seemed like for a long time and I remember thinking this is the oddest thing that just two minutes ago I was a woman who was engaged to be married and who had had some significant difficulties in her life but had more or less overcome them and now all of a sudden my whole life narrative is gonna change and I'm gonna be a woman who from this point on will say that she watched her lover burn to death in a fire and how strange that would suddenly become a plot point in my life now I remember thinking that and then I and then the moment passed and I ran forward and just as I did that he was holding a beaker in his hand the fire was some chemical that had should never have touched air and because air got into it spontaneously combusted and he dropped the beaker and he started like padding the fire out even though his hands were also on fire he he just stamped it out all over his body and then but the chemical fire is different from a normal fire and that this this fire as soon as it was out of his body and he was now no longer on fire it was sort of leaping and like skipping around the room and his this lab was just packed with chemicals that should not have been in the house I mean they were just this is packed with toxic combustible chemicals and I pulled him out of the lab and I was like come on we got to go we got to go that house is gonna blow up we got to go now and he kept running back into the lab and finally there was a sort of strange tug of war between us and then he managed to get back into the lab and he took this fire extinguisher that I guess he obviously had there for just this sort of event and he couldn't figure out how to work it and then he figured out how to work it and the fire extinguisher like and the whole room went up and like white this white like foam with this rancid stink and we ran up stairs and his his hair was gone his eyelashes were gone his skin was bubbling and I was like I love you I love you I love you I ran to the freezer I started throwing like whatever I could and you like ice cubes drop a can of cans whatever just a throwing them at him and I just can't say I love you I love you and he's like chemist to the very end he's like Lauren just stay calm go to the CVS and get me zinc oxide and aloe vera and bandages so I went to the CVS and I got him this stuff and it was in the car that like his screams just kept going in my head it wasn't even the sight of him on fire it was his screams and I came back and soon after that we went to the emergency room and he had some scarring on his ear drum but he was pronounced basically hairless but okay but the thing was that I wasn't okay after that because I kept hearing his screams and I kept thinking what you know more than the sight of him it was those it was the vision it was the sound of him and it I kept thinking I agreed to marry this man and when you agreed to marry someone you you agree to a degree of intimacy that includes all kinds of intimate sounds but this was a sound that I did not agree to ever hear and this was the sound of like the cortex being peeled back and like pure limbic terror I knew what he would sound like at the moment of death and I did not want that knowledge of him and I did not know if I could marry him with that knowledge and what basically happened is that I became depressed and our relationship became depressed I'd always thought that a really that depression was something that happened just to an individual but from this experience I learned that it can happen depression can be the third variable it can happen between people we had you know all the diagnostic criteria we had the neuro vegetative symptoms we had psychomotor retardation we stopped having sex our appetites and all sorts of ways fell off and I remember thinking I really really don't know if I can marry this man because his screams kept replying in my head and I didn't know how I would ever integrate that with the rest of him or with our relationship now it's about four or five years later and and I am you've actually my ring fell off but I am in fact married and and so I think I've been thinking like what was it that enabled me to move beyond those screams and move beyond that knowledge of him and move beyond the depression that existed between us and I don't have any grand answers but I do have some sort of clues and one of them is just simply time as time went on low and behold his screams started to sort of fade in my mind and I was able to sort of put them in a different place in my brain and also as time went on I was able to start remembering the event a little bit differently and this is something that is interesting in depression when you're depressed you will look at your past and see it in one way and as the depression starts to lift you maybe look at your past or look at past events and see them in another way and whereas while we were depressed I had thought this guy is just such a loser he's such a goon I can't believe he was blew up our house I started thinking I started remembering well he had got the fire extinguished he did figure out how to work it in a crisis and like that's something I never would have been able to do and I started to sort of see him as being potentially competent again where I hadn't seen that way before and the other thing that happened was I went to a writer's conference and this was the first time we'd been away from each other in a while and I got really really drunk at this writer's conference and there was all these famous writers are like Susan or Lee and Gourvey Don like that some it wasn't Janet Mazin but it was some really serious higher up at the New York Times and I got I got really really drunk and I and I told them the whole story of the fire like at this at this conference at this dinner and I said should I marry him and they were all like don't definitely do not marry this guy this is a mistake except Gourvey Don said I should marry and if Gourvey Don says you should marry someone then you should marry them that was what I thought so I came back and we decided that we were in fact gonna go ahead and get married and Benjamin said given everything that we've been through the kind of wedding hyperposes that we have a naked wedding and you know I said that's just that's not gonna happen that's definitely not gonna happen you know you blew up the house you're not gonna get a naked wedding and he said he said it's really important given the dissent in the ascent and the symbolism of all this that we have a naked wedding and this is one thing that I really really want so I said if you really really want a naked wedding you can have your naked wedding I'm wearing a towel so he said all right you wear a towel but everybody who comes has to be naked too and I said there's no way that my friends who are all writers and are so significant neuroses and anxieties there's no way that my friends are gonna come to our wedding and be naked and you can't force them to do that and he said well all right it's it's voluntary whatever but in any case the day the day before the wedding like this kind of strange giddiness came over me it's a giddiness that I like and sometimes to what happens when a depression is lifted and you're like whoa life here it is and I just like I went to a tattoo parlor and I got this this belt tattooed around my waist of all of his favorite molecules including the molecular structure of fire and I thought I was I was thinner at the time and I thought this this tattoo belt looks really awesome I mean maybe I should go naked and but I still was up in the air but it's only the day of the wedding comes he's in a bathroom I'm in a bathroom our friends come over and the weirdest thing oh he hired two witches to officiate this ceremony although they were also they were also like Lee they could legally marry it but so the witches come all my writer friends come you know they've got you know all kinds of aches and pains and are just what I just not the type to go naked and the weirdest thing is that his friends all went naked and the strange hush came over house and I swear this is true my friends all drop trout they all went naked his parents went naked and then it was time for us we came downstairs we walked down the stairs I was he we were both in a bath in bath robes and he took off his bathrobe and then I took off my bathrobe and I was naked and we got married that way but I wasn't facing the crowd I was facing away from the crowd so it was only my back and then at the end these witches who were pierced like all over said you know be in order to completely consummate your wedding you now need to turn around and face the crowd which is something that having a large chest I was like that was just totally something I didn't think that I could do but I did we both turned around and we faced the crowd and I was just like here I am and it was this is moment when we were like when we were you know completely bare and silly and scared and strong and all of those things together and it was at that moment that you know we said I do and sickness and an health for better and for worse and we're still married today"
86,christmas1940.wav," Igor was my Russian uncle. He wasn't really my uncle, but I called him uncle because like many a child, I found somebody outside of my family who I thought was marvelous. The best friend I could have. I met Igor in France when I was a child of seven. My mother was French and we used to go to France every summer and we were having lunch and I heard my father speaking Russian, which he really did. I turned and saw this very elegant man with a beautiful jacket and an elegant silk scarf. My father and he were just having a good old time of it because I found out later they shared something which was escape from Zara's Russia and hatred for Stalin's dictatorship. My father and my parents became good friends with Igor and whenever he saw me, he always saluted me very nicely with a little bow and called me Monsieur Pierre. Or sometimes he would look at me with a big twinkle in his eye and say, hello, Pyotr Veliki. Pyotr Veliki means Peter the Great in Russian. When we were in Paris, Igor used to take me around to buy a nice present to go back to New York with. We would go to the zoo together and ride the little trains. We would go to the, grunk in your puppets in Luxembourg Gardens, but best of all, you would take me to Foucaix's, the Shahzidizé for ice cream. That idyllic period ended when France surrendered to the Germans and most of my family's friends and relatives disappeared from view, including Uncle Igor. I asked my father, do you know where Igor is? He said no, but I have an idea. I think he may be hiding somewheres and if you write him a letter, maybe he will get it, somebody will find it and give it to him and then he will write back to you. So I wrote a letter to Uncle Igor hoping beyond hope that he would get it and I signed it, Pyotr Veliki. The letter came back stamped undeliverable and my father had a grim look and he walked out of the room and said, hope Igor hasn't fallen into the hellhole of a German concentration camp. I know what he meant and I was afraid. Then one day we got a letter with a return address in Lisbon and my father opened it and it was from Igor. He told him his escape just ahead of the Gestapo and he got to Lisbon where now he was broke and the landlord was going to throw him out in the street and he ended his letter with a simple plea that seemed so powerful in huge capital letters he wrote at the end of his letter. Edimwa helped me. Papa I said can we help Igor? Of course. Now we can get him to New York. Hooray I said. My father had friends in the State Department and he'd done a lot to help people get from Europe to the United States. He also gave me a map and showed me where Lisbon was and then he told me to read the shipping news in the New York Times every day because that way I could tell him where Igor was day by day. So on the day Igor said say it from Lisbon I rushed into my father and said Papa Igor is on his way it sits so in the shipping news and Igor stopped about four or five places before he got to New York and finally the day before he was to arrive in New York I told my Papa Igor is coming he's coming he's coming he's almost here. So we went down to the pier where the ship was going to come in my mother had a beautiful bouquet of roses for him. When the passengers started coming down the gang plague I looked and looked and waved and waved and Igor never showed up. What I didn't know was that they had taken him off the ship to Hoboken and on Hoboken they put him on another ship to Cartagena in Columbia. I never even got to see him. I asked my father are we going to be able to save Igor. It's going to be difficult he said and I was scared I did not want Igor to go into a German concentration camp and then one day we got a telegram from Igor and he said that they were going to put him on a ship back to France where he would face certain imprisonment and I looked at my father I said Papa what can we do to save Igor he said I'm trying then for some mysterious reason we will give it information that the ship was going to go to Vancouver in Canada before leaving for France and it's a long trip and I said to my father Papa, Papa Igor can get off in Vancouver and he can come here and that is exactly what happened. Igor walked down the gang plank in Vancouver melted into the crowds of people that you find on a dock and disappeared a free man. I never ever did find out how it happened. A few weeks later Igor came to New York on Christmas Day 1940 and it was a crowd of about 30 people in our house all of them were friends of Igor who couldn't wait to see him and they were also refugees. He bounded up the stairs and when they saw him they embraced him they hugged him they kissed him they spoke passionate Russian you know animated French they kissed and they hugged and finally he saw me and he picked me up kissed me and both cheeks and said pure ture veliki, her summer faye plays yielded to voie I'm so happy to see you somebody then yelled out how did you escape Igor and he told a very complicated story of Chris Gossing France ahead of the Gestapo and finally getting to Lisbon the part I liked the best was when he included me in this story he was trying to get some food from an old peasant lady who said she had nothing and you know me friends he said and he's very heavy Russian accent I don't give up so easily so I talked to her some more and then out of the corner of my eye I see a little boy has come into the room and you know what Piotr veliki he looked just like you he reminded me of you and that gave me courage so I told the old lady all kinds of stories about you what a wonderful person you were and I said wouldn't it be great if the two boys could become friends and play together and I looked at her and she was crying and she said you know what I think maybe I can find some food for you and they were cheers in the crowd in applause Igor's appearance was transformative when he told the story I was escaped from the Nazi nightmare it was perhaps the first time since the fall of France that a glimmer of hope lit up the eyes of all those refugees gathered in our home Christmas day 1940 was a magical moment Igor was safe and in America and he was sleeping in my room"
87,legacy.wav," So, about a month into my daughter's kindergarten career, beginning of her being in school, I was informed by her mother that her teacher was concerned about how she was doing in a month into kindergarten. You would think that there's not a whole lot that you need to know how to do, but apparently my daughter was giving her teacher a claustrophic concern. And so at the earliest opportunity, which was the parental observation day around Halloween, I went in to observe the class and it was all very familiar. And it was clear to me what her teacher meant, even though it had been delivered to me in a really ambiguous and hard to understand way. I watched my daughter just be herself in this classroom kind of blissfully unaware of what was expected of her. It seems all very innocent kindergarten and everything, but that's where they start training you how to be a part of society, which if you're into that kind of thing, that's awesome. You don't have much choice in this world. But so I'm watching her and watching her do her thing and watching her teach to get frustrated with her to the point of like near anger, just because she's not jumping to the next thing that's being assigned to her because they have like little sections in the day or in the afternoon for they have to work on. And it was very familiar. A nice thing that can happen with having children is that you can see yourself and you can be reminded of the progression of your own life through viewing them. And I was brought back to my experience being kindergarten and I can see myself very clearly in my daughter. We share a lot of similarities. And I remember being handed like rudimentary mathematics that you're supposed to start in kindergarten and not being interested at all. So not even bothering. It wasn't clear to me that you were that was like required. It was clear to me that she was kind of in the same place. And her teacher, besides rubbing me the wrong way, you know, in a lot of ways, clearly didn't understand my daughter. I didn't want my daughter to stay in that school. I wanted her out. And that could be just, it's hard to say when you're dealing with your children because you know, everyone thinks that their children or God's gift to the planet, you know, or saying people do, saying people do. So I wanted her out. I didn't think it was a good place for her, but I didn't think anything was wrong with her. But of course I didn't because I'm her father. And it's very difficult to see your children clearly because I would like to say because of the incredible amount of love that you have for them. But that's not totally honest because there's something besides the love that's ego involved because there's such a reflection of you. You want them to do good. You want them to be smart. You want them to be beautiful because you're smart and you're beautiful and you're good, you know, or that's how you want to perceive yourself in this world. And you want your children, you're offspring to have that. That's maybe a little ugly, but it's true. And I think it's true for most parents. So I do love my daughter, A. Great Deal. And I love myself. And I wanted her out of that school and her mother, a very fine woman, brilliant and beautiful. We're partnered in raising her where you're not partnered romantically. Didn't want to hear me that maybe the teacher had the problem because she was beginning a career as a teacher and she always heard parents talk about how it was a teacher's problem and that they wouldn't be able to actually see their children. And I had no idea how hard it was to be a teacher with all these kids and not blah, blah, blah, I'm sure she had points, but we really, we're very, very good at disagreeing. We can disagree very strongly. But I can see myself in my kid and I can see myself sitting at the kindergarten desk that she was sitting at. I can see the similarities and a lot of the similarities come done to an attribute that is slowness, like a real slowness that we share that has been like frustrating to teachers and parents and friends and lovers and roommates and a number of people. For instance, it really can and often does take me an hour to put on my shoes and I can't tell you where the time goes. It's not like I got distracted and started playing records or something like I can sit in the same place putting on my socks and shoes for an hour. So can my daughter, we can lose weekends just sitting on the toilet. And if there's a apartment where I spend time with my daughter, there's only one toilet. So that's easy for me to see the similarities. Thinking about how we see our children and how we see ourselves and our children and how we want to see ourselves in a positive light. We don't want something to be wrong with our children. It makes me think about a moment in time when I was 17 years old and I was watching television with my father episode of Nova. It was like a science program that was on, I think it was on PBS. I don't know if it still exists. This one was on neuroscience and neuroscience technology and they had a guy getting prepared for a cat scan and being receiving a cat scan and it filled me with this crazy wave of like deja vu but not just regular deja vu. Like deja vu mixed with dread and like sickness to my stomach. And it was overwhelming and I couldn't stop thinking about it and wondering like did I have a cat scan? So I turned to my father and asked him if I had a cat scan. He said no and he fell back asleep and then I couldn't get out of my head and I started remembering more and more this experience of being a little kid and getting a cat scan. Anna, I finally went to my mother, asked her and she didn't want to talk about it when I persisted and she admitted that I had had a cat scan when I was six years old, something like that. And they asked her why I had a cat scan and she didn't want to talk about it but she started laughing a little bit and which is weird. From where I was standing, you know, kind of filled with dread and having like this like repressed memory come up and finally she admitted I had a cat scan and she told me why she said that I was so slow that they thought that I was retarded and I'd be given a battery of test to test my cognitive ability and the test were inconclusive and they couldn't figure out the jury still out trust me. But the test were inconclusive so they thought that maybe I just had a brain tumor and so that's why I got the cat scan. I don't know if you've ever had one but I didn't even like giving blood for a blood test. I don't, this is actually thinking about it right now probably exactly why I hate Western medicine entirely and we'll do anything to stay away from a doctor. Well a cat scan, they have to like take your clothes off if you're a little and you don't want to take your clothes off in a room full of strangers and then this is my memory so I don't know. I inject something into your ankle like an iodine solution and then you lay you on a table and you get slid into a tube that sends whatever rays through your body to look into your brain to see what's going on. Totally fucking terrifying. Like I remembered trying to escape, I remembered screaming until I was worse. I remembered my father coming into the room and talking me down. I remember having my clothes put back on and taken to the gift shop and my father bought me a book of animal limericks and and rhymes and photographs of the animals, all these animals from North America. Black hardcovered book. I remember that book and I had it to childhood but I didn't remember anything about the cat scan after I left the hospital because it sucked that bad. My parents loved me, loved their children and that couldn't have been anything but painful and frightening from my father too, you know, the whole situation. And so I'm just thinking about what motivated them to go to that extreme to see what was wrong with me. Okay, so it turns out that no brain tumor as a child just slow. I'm just slow. I figured out ways to live my life that it doesn't really matter as far as survival is concerned. And actually I've been able to thrive, you know, by degrees. And I had to think about that. It's so tempted to sing. So tempted to push it so past the time that she starts playing and I have to improvise a song on top of it to finish the story. I won't do that. Just thinking about not doing that to my child, you know, having the having the good fortune to have a child, it's so much like me that I can take my experiences and help her at least in this moment. I don't know what the future holds and I don't know who she's going to become, you know, but I can use my experience in a way to lessen her potential problems in this world, which is what you ultimately, ultimately, ultimately wish for as a parent. Her mother went to talk to the teacher a couple weeks later and came back horrified and wanted to, but she's not a violent person, but she wanted our daughter out too. So we took our daughter out of that school. She's not a diner school, which really suits her much better and we're both slow."
88,thetriangleshirtwaistconnection.wav," All right, so it's March 20th, 1990, and I'm working as a health and safety union rep for the International Lady Garment Workers Union in Manhattan on Broadway and 53rd right near Central Park. And I'm working late because I always work late and I get a phone call from Ruben, the security guard, and I don't usually get calls from him, and he calls me and he says, there's a guy in the lobby and he wants to see you. He says he knows you, and I'm like, what's his name? He said, Richard Price. I'm like, in Richard Price, I don't know a Richard Price. He said, well, he's got a letter from you, and it's laminated. I said, laminated. And so I was very confused, and he said, well, the letter says you send him some books on the triangle shirt waistfire, and then I remembered there was this letter that no one wanted to answer, but I was low-seniority. So they gave it, you know, my boss gave it to me to answer. And it was a guy named Richard Price from Three Rivers, Michigan, and he was somebody who, by the letter you could tell, he was really different. He talked about his obsession with the triangle shirt waistfire and how much it meant to him. Now, if you don't know the triangle shirt waistfire, it's a big moment in labor history, especially for the Garment Workers Union. It was in 1911, March 25th, in Lower Manhattan, the ash building, the three top floors was a sweatshop, and a rag caught on fire and went through the whole shop. And there was 146 mostly young immigrant women, teenagers, who were killed in that fire. Because the owner of the sweatshop kept the doors locked to keep its theft down, had unworking elevators, and the firefighters, their ladders, only went to the floor right below them. So these women were burned and many of them jumped to their death. So it was a very traumatic thing, but it brought about a lot of change in health and safety, and it really spurred the International Lady Garment Workers Union. So he was really into this, and he told me how he had even done a big display about it at the Three Rivers Public Library, and then gotten the library cited for fire code violations. And he told, in a letter, he said he'd gotten a lot of the businesses in Three Rivers cited for fire code violations. So he was different, and I was sort of struck by it, and I sent him some books on the Triangle Shirt waistfire and a nice letter that he gave him for his interest, and I didn't think anything of it. And I didn't even think anything of it when the mayor of Three Rivers called me a little while later and said, Richard Price just wanted to let you know, he's a good guy, the community really loves him, even though he keeps writing people, stop him getting them cited for fire code violations. And so, and I vaguely remembered him saying he was going to come for the 79th anniversary of the Triangle Shirt waistfire on March 25th. So I went down to the lobby, and there he was, he was a big guy in his mid-20s, he had his buttons, his flannel shirt, all buttoned all the way to the top, and he had a code on it was like, you know, crooked, and on a backpack. And I looked at him and you could tell he thought it was really important, but he looked down at the ground, he wouldn't look me in the eye, he just looked really bashful and adorable, and I asked him, you know, how did you get here? Where are you staying? And he said, well, I shoveled dryways all winter long, and Three Rivers Misshagen, so I had enough money to get round trip train ticket here, and an extra 100 bucks. I said, so you got as 100 bucks? He said, yeah, so where are you staying? He goes, well, last night I slept on a park bench in Central Park, and I was like, oh no, because if 1990s New York, it was the crack epidemic was still raging, and there was, you know, people, homeless people getting hurt all the time, and in fact, I remember that someone had been burned on the park bench in Central Park, not that long before. So I was like, oh no, oh no, no, no, no, I can't, I can't have this, so I start calling people and friends and shelters, and there's nothing available. And so I called my husband, now we had only been married a couple of years, and we had a tiny little place in the Bronx of 250 square feet maybe, and the smaller half of a second floor of a house, and I called my husband, and I said, I told him the story, and he said, can I bring him home? And he said, of course, which is why I love him so much. But Ruben, the security guard, it was also off duty cop, he said, Michelle, are you sure? You don't know this guy. You got a little baby at home. I had a nine-month-old baby at home, and he knew, at the same time, he walked and pregnant all the time, and knew that baby was there, and he goes, I, you really sure, and my friends who came out said, Michelle, you're crazy. This doesn't, this doesn't make sense, don't do it, but I had made up my mind, I'm doing it, there's no other alternative, I'm not letting him sleep in a park bench in Central Park. So I brought him home, and you know what? We had an awesome time. We had a great time. We showed him how to go around New York. We took him out. We even took him some friends of ours, a local garment local union in Manhattan. He learned how to manange, he learned how to salsa, he ate Puerto Rican food, but the best part of the week is when I took him to the anniversary of the memorial of the Triangle Shirtways fire. It was in front of the ash building where the fire had occurred. He met all of these union dignitaries. He even met some of the descendants of people who had died in the fire, and he was beaming, and I was just basking in his happiness and felt so good. And he went home, we got him on the train back, and then a few days later I get this call from the executive vice president's office on the top floor, and I'm like, oh, maybe she's noticing all these late hours I'm working, but no, that wasn't it. I go up there and she lit into me, and you know what she said? She said I was irresponsible. She said I put my son at risk. What kind of mother was I? She said what kind of a person would put the union at risk? You're making us liable, and I thought she was going to fire me, but I was crying so hard that I think she just felt sorry for me, so she said if you ever do this again, you will be fired. And I bit my tongue because I was soul support, my husband was a stay-at-home dad, and I needed that job. So I know now that Richard had autism, you know, the way he was obsessed with a certain subject, the way he looked down and when looking at face and the way he didn't seem to care if he got his neighbors written up for fire code violations. But I think about it, and I know this because that little baby that everyone cared so much about, he's the same age as Richard now, and he has autism, that's my son. The one Eddie Hake had told you about. And so I ask you, when you see somebody on the street, maybe they need help, maybe they're just passing by, people might say they're crazy, might seem different, please be kind. Treat them like they could be your own son."
89,theclosetthatateeverything.wav," My mom was a really amazing person. She was the type of person that could take any mundane life event and turn it into a party in about 10 minutes flat. She was really, really into holidays. And she could take our normal suburban Pittsburgh house and turn it into all these magical worlds. And not just for holidays that everybody decorates for, we had a special set of flags that were just for Memorial Day, that were different than the flags that we used on the 4th of July. Christmas was a really big deal. We had a tree in every room, and every tree had a theme. She liked themes. I never had a birthday party that didn't have one. There was the Victorian Tea Party and the Fitness Birthday Party. I'm an only child, what can I say? I think she just really wanted everything to be special. But growing up like this, that also meant that our house had a lot of stuff in it. If we're being honest, she was a pack rat verging onto a hoarder. She had all the tendencies. If she saw something she liked, she bought three of them. She had all of these materials for projects that she never even started, let alone finished. She saved everything, like normal stuff that parents saved schoolwork, but then old bits of wrapping paper and ribbons. She never threw away a piece of clothes. She had two closets and two armwars just full of her clothing. And that was kind of her MO. If you walked into our house, you would never know that she had all of this stuff, because it was all tucked away into closets and drawers, nooks, crannies. The attic was so full that we weren't even allowed to go in it. And it was all Christmas decorations. So as much as I loved this celebration, I could just never wrap my brain around the amount of stuff. Even as a child, I just didn't understand the point of having things that we only used once a year, or that she would just buy and forget about. So now I'm someone who compulsively cleans. When I open my own closet and I see something that I haven't looked at or thought about for a couple months, it immediately goes to Goodwill. I'm not super sentimental with things. My husband might get me a card and write a little note in it, and I'll put it out and then find a way to quietly get rid of it. So growing up in this house, I just I never could understand all this stuff. I was just more pragmatic than she ever was. She was also really sick for my entire life. We had a lot of holidays and hospitals or when she was bedridden, but then never really slowed her down. She always dragged herself out of bed and got the stuff up. And when she passed away, when I was 25, it was sudden, but it wasn't necessarily unexpected. So while my dad and I weren't really prepared for it, emotionally, we had had a chance to deal with that mentally. So that first Christmas, after she passed away, we decided we're going to do the thing. Track down the decorations. We thought as many of them as we could, we put them all up, and we had a whole family over. And I cooked my first turkey all by myself. And even though she wasn't there and it wasn't quite the same, it felt OK. This is the new normal. We can figure this out. About a year after that, I got the phone call from my dad. I'm going to sell the house. It's too big. And I took this a lot harder than your average adult does. It was the only house that I had ever lived in my entire life from when I was born until I went away to college. And I just couldn't imagine a world in where I wasn't going back to that house. But despite my hesitations, this is what's happening. So I go home to help him clean out the house. And immediately, it is just stuff overwhelm. I mean, there's 20 years worth of stuff here that nobody has ever really gone through. And I live in Brooklyn in an apartment. What am I going to do with a formal dining room table and like eight chairs that are so heavy I can barely lift them, let alone an entire attic full of Christmas decorations. And it immediately just made me feel like a pretty terrible daughter because I knew the expectation was that I was supposed to keep all of this stuff, that somehow one day I was going to have my own house and I was going to fill it up with the stuff. And our lives were just really different. That was never going to be my thing. So I'm standing there having this moment in the house, looking at this dining room table and my dad says to me, you've got to go clean out the closet in the bedroom. In my house for my entire life, this specific closet was always called the closet that eats everything. And it was called this because if you lost something in my house, no matter where this item originated from, it wound up in this closet. Like that room in Harry Potter, where all the missing stuff goes. It was like a series of pneumatic tubes like would connect the garage and the kitchen. And no matter where this item originated, it wound up in this closet. And it would like lose a shirt. And I'd be like, Mom, have you seen my shirt? Oh, well, did you check the closet that eats everything? No, Mom, why would it be in there? And she'd like open the door and pull out the shirt. Is this one you're looking for? It just happened more times that I could count. But the real reason that I was anxious about going into this closet was because it was also where we kept all of the family photos and the scrapbooking materials. So I made a plan. I was not going to engage with any of the stuff. I was just going to sort the stuff. Because nostalgia is the enemy of all successful cleaning expeditions. So family photos keep one pile, old, unsent greeting cards throw away, another pile. And that lasted for about five minutes before I'm knee deep in the family photos, going through every single one of them. And I'm looking at pictures of us around that ugly table Thanksgiving. And a bunch of six-year-old girls and puffy dresses having a tea party. And photos of Christmas trees that were so beautiful that they could have been in magazines. And all that stuff started to get really real again. And that is when I noticed this box. It's just a normal cardboard box that looked kind of new. So my first thought was like, oh my god, here's another thing that she bought that she didn't even know that she had. But I picked it up. And the contents inside were like shifting a little bit. And it was heavy. So I opened it. And I looked down and it is a box of greeting cards. OK, so she got the guy at Hallmark to give her the overstock for some reason. But then I noticed them. And none of them have any envelopes. And I thought that was weird. So I picked up the first card. And it was a first birthday card. It was my first birthday card. It said, too Morgan on it. And when you opened it up, it had slots inside of it where you're supposed to put pennies from the year that the baby is born. And all of the 1983 pennies were still in there. So I keep digging through this box. And there's more first birthday cards. And there's cards from Christmas and Halloween, because who gives greeting cards on Halloween? And Thanksgiving and birthdays and Valentine's Day and cards that I had received just because, or because we had a fight. And it dawns on me. And it's apparent that this entire box is every single greeting card that was ever exchanged between me, my mom, and my dad, from the time that I was born up until the fairy-leaf recent past. And I just did not understand this box. And it made me really angry and upset, because there was obviously something that I was supposed to know about this box, something that she knew. She was saving these things for a reason. But I didn't know what it was. And now, all of a sudden, here's this box of memories that I am confronted with. This is what I was so worried about losing in the house. But now they're my responsibility. And before I knew it, my whole body just started sort of reacting without me and I panicked. And I started to throw everything away, just ripping things and throwing them. And I'm weeping. And that's how my dad found me was like in a pile of greeting cards, and he was surrounded by stuff. So I tell him about the box. And we start to sort of calmly go through it. And he picks up a card, and he looks at it. And he says, I remember getting this birthday card. I had it on my desk for a while. And then I threw it away. I specifically remember throwing this card away. So now we have this moment where we're laughing together at this image of my mom, like digging through the trash to save greeting cards. And it just dawned on us that we're never going to know the answer to this mystery that she's gone. And I'm looking through cards, and I see cards that I signed my name to, but that I don't remember buying and cards that have my name on them, but that I don't really remember getting. And without her, without her logic and her magic, they were just stuff. They were just her stuff. The box, the cards, they weren't my memories to save. They were her memories. And she had just saved so much stuff that none of it was really special anymore, to me, that the most special thing about this box was that she had cared enough to save it in the first place. And then I got to experience that one more time. So we each took a few things, and ultimately we decided we could let it go. We could get rid of the rest of them. We took them to the recycling bin. And the next day I went back to New York, and I never set foot in that house again. But I had this new sense of calm about the whole thing. And in the back seat with me on my drive was a box of Christmas ornaments, and a card full of 1983 pennies."
90,dialogue6.wav," I went to Vietnam with an activation, straight to me, Condelta. And things happened. You couldn't see the enemy. They were shooting at us from the jungles. And I went on my kids' kill. This young man died in my arms. And when I came in that day off that mission, this captain, he said I was going home. And I didn't want to go. I don't want to leave my men. He said, it's an order from Washington. You have to go back and you're going to back to train for the Olympics. And I told my men, I said, I'm going back for you. I'm going to win this gold medal for you guys. When we got to Mexico, we started getting threats from the president of the Olympic Committee saying, if we demonstrated in the Olympics, I'm going to send all you boys home. Are you going to call somebody boy? I mean, here I just got out of combat. Saying people die, you know, defending my country. You're going to call me a boy. They don't make boys like me. Colonel Miller called all of a sudden and said, you know, you in the military, you know, you can't get involved in any kind of demonstration. I said, I've been going to the meetings, yes. I said, we all have. We all black. This because I'm in the military. I don't make me any different. But I'm not going to do anything. It's going to disgrace my family and my military career. To be on the relay team, it was my time to shine. I ran my heart out. We ended up winning the race at a world record time at 38.2 seconds. I go metal. Right. John Carlos was your roommate? Yes. Carlos was my roommate when they was on that Victor stand with the black glove, the black socks, no shoes and bow they had. How did it make you feel proud when you saw that? Proud. You know, when Carlos came back to the room, I could see the hurt in his eyes and he just said, I did what I had to do, male. And that's when I told myself, so proud of you. It was not trying to disgrace the national anthem of America, what was happening was wrong. They were trying to show the world, hey, we are human beings. We are human that changed my life. I would go where you could pick up care packages and they just put them up male female. I always went to the girl ones because I liked the sense better, I liked the so better. I would tease you. I like the lotion. I still do. And instead of the sports illustrated in the men's health, I would go find the vogue and then reclares, once I retired, I don't know what I was going to do with myself. You lost yourself. I mean, I tried being a motorcycle mechanic. That lasted about three weeks. And then I don't know, number of nights and early mornings and dive bars and passed out in parks. I would have to go and find you in the yard at night when you would have flashbacks. Do you can foxhole with, I guess? When I decided I was going to sew, I came home with that sewing machine and I was like, I'm going to do it right now. And I literally just shook my head. Do you remember the first thing I made? Yes, a purse. It was upside down. And inside out. That first, it was just a hobby. And then you know, it blossomed from there. Yep. Those first designs, I didn't know how to do zippers. I couldn't do sleeves. And I just, it was, it wasn't, it wasn't ever really about, but it didn't frustrate you. You just kept working. And that was just it. It was, because at that time, it was so much about finding my piece, so much of the world is just noise. And for me, it's that noise that brings the anxiety. When I sew that world of noise and chaos is a world that I have control over, it's only six inches. And that's my six inches. And no one else can get in there. And I think for me, that's, that's where the piece is. My dad, he will always tell me to put him in a chokehold and he will easily break it. And I was always so impressed by that strength. He was my hero, man. I remember he had the white boots, the white mask with kind of like a red beak. It was the Falcon. He was the Falcon. Yes. And my dad was a neat freak. So he fold things a certain way. And everything was in this giant gym bag. And every day I would look at that bag and say, man, there's stardom in that bag. But he would discourage me when I was young. He always said, you could be something better than that. Dr. lawyer. And then our relationship collided. There were a lot of absences from him growing up. But the thing that always brought us back was wrestling. Over the phone, we will talk about wrestling for like hours. And I remember he said, I want to tag team with you one day. And so you started training me. I learned that you wanted to start wrestling. So I said, well, let's see what I could do. And I trained almost every day. I told my dad and he said, I'll be there Saturday for your debut match. That Thursday I get a phone call from my cousin. And he's like, did you hear? And I was like, no, what? And he said, get father. And when he said my father, I already knew. I said, my dad died. And he could barely say, yeah, over the phone. I remember leaning against the wall and just breaking down crying. And on the day of my debut, I was at the cemetery burying my dad. That's when I decided that wrestling was my legacy. One of the things I think about, if he was still alive today, how would he feel? I think he'd be proud because I see a lot in you and him. You're certain wrestling moves. I'm like, I've seen that before. And sometimes when I talk to you, I feel like I'm talking to you, dad again. Even the laugh. People don't know it. But when you laugh, I hear them all the time. You know, I want to keep his name alive. And that's what I've been doing ever since. I noticed you with the hat. And I noticed that you were surrounded by some people. And I noticed that they were being kind of threatening. I heard a click of a lighter right behind my ear. And there were about three people trying to light my shirt on fire with lighters. And then somebody snatched your head off your head. And that's the point where I, something kind of snapped inside me because I was, I'm with some hijab. And I've been in situations where people have tried to snatch it off my head. Wow. And I rushed towards you and I just started screaming. They've been alone. Give me that back. I don't think we could be any further apart as people. And yet it was just kind of like this common. That's not okay moment. You are genuinely the only Muslim person I know. I just, it's not that I've actively avoided. It's just, I've just never been in the position where I can interact for an extended period of time. So I guess my views on the Muslim community have been influenced by a lot of the news articles and things of that nature. I feel like a lot of times in the media, you don't see the normal Muslim, the one that listens to classic arc like I do. You don't, you don't meet that Muslim. Can you tell me about where you grew up? What was that probably your life like? So I was born in Baghdad in Iraq. I moved to the US when I was 10 years old. Okay. Being a Muslim girl. I stood out in almost every single way that you can in middle school the worst time to stand out. What about you? How was it like when you grow up? I was homeschooled. So it was, it was a vastly different experience socially. It was, I didn't have, I guess as many friends as most people would. I only went to public school one year of my life and I got in three fights and I lost all of them. I've actually lost a lot of friends because of the selection because of my political stance. So I hope that I can be the reason that someone decides to talk to someone as opposed to just cutting them out of their life or blocking them on Twitter. I'd like for this to encourage other people to engage in more conversations with people that you don't agree with. What's all about? I'm so glad it wasn't the only thing I felt like that. When we left that night we already had the globe the fire behind us. You're hearing on the radio all the places that you can go to but nobody's telling you which way to go. And people start driving up onto the sidewalks in the front yard because the street is completely packed. You're like an aunt with a magnifying glass chasing you and you're just randomly going but you don't know if it's going to be safe ahead of you. We were able to get back to our house right away after the fire. It looked normal until you got closer to the railroad tracks and then you'd see one house burned and then two houses were fine. And then all of a sudden you got past the railroad and everything was gone. You don't know what street you're on because everything looks the same burnt and twisted metal and just ash everywhere. Our oldest daughter almost fell over when she saw the house. She cried and we just held each other for a long time. It just was a numbing feeling. You know, it's like what do you do? I mean it's gone. I just wanted to punch stuff really but that doesn't do anything. It's hard not thinking that maybe there was a chance that you could have saved something else. And I keep going back there and I'm like, okay maybe I should shift one more time and I might find my wedding ring or maybe if I look I can find my daughter's rock that she really liked and your native American. We had these beautiful baskets for each one of our children. Yeah, you'd have designs weaved into the basket tree. So when we lost all those things it was the hardest part to deal with. You don't want to let go of the past because that's how we learned how to live and be who we are. It's hard because that okay, oh we have caring forward really. At this point is our DNA, you know. Yeah. Friends and family call us and ask how we're doing and they don't want to hear that we're not doing okay. There's always a talk about getting back to normal or getting over it but I think everything will forever be different for us."
91,dialogue1.wav," It was our third day before we saw each other dressed. And that was a good thing because I had seen you dressed on the first date. I probably wouldn't have dated you again. You wore those two different round plaids together that was terrible. Do you remember the day you met me? Yes. I seen a big beautiful woman walking around. Very vibrant, very articulate. And I decided I wanted to meet you. Remember at the party you asked me to dance? Mm-hmm. And I always had a rule. Never slow dance with anyone at Indian Hills. We giggled proudly for the first 30, 40 seconds at a song. And then we fell into each other and started talking. And I don't think we ever separated after that. I felt it was easier to communicate like a certain barrier, obviously. Had been lost and we could just talk more openly than you would the first time you meet somebody. That's right. After 10 minutes, it felt like we do each other all our lives. It was love at first sight. But we had this issue with timing. You are really like to be early for everything. And I kind of never been on time for anything. And then our friend from the park passed away one week to the day after we met. And the memorial service was set for two o'clock. Three o'clock, I pulled up with the devil's eggs. So I took off all my clothes, threw them in the car, grabbed the eggs, I was running past the pool into the clubhouse. And I put the devil's eggs on the table, turned around, and everyone in the clubhouse was wearing their clothes. It was just like, what is this fool doing? At that point, I really thought you were never going to ask me out again. But you and I do a great job of balancing each other. That's right, love. Somehow you always figure out a way to turn it into something good. And that's what I love about you. And our favorite saying is what? It's hard to be mean when you're naked. That's right. I love you. I appreciate you every day. Summer 2010, we had six babies in the nursery who were in withdrawal. It was so hard to watch. These babies, they would have trimmers, they're inconsolable, and we couldn't fix it. We couldn't make these babies better. A little did we know, that was the tip of the iceberg. We had 10 and then 15 and then at one point, 37 babies in the NICU that were withdrawing. We were burst into seams. We were completely unprepared and short-staffed. And I remember a nurse in tears holding a baby and this baby's just screaming. And she said, we have got to do something because what we're doing wasn't working. And here we were just a small children's hospital in East Tennessee. And these babies were carrying the flag of the substance abuse problem in the United States. And so we went looking to the experts, let's call across the country and let's find out was the best way to treat these babies. And then that moment of nobody knows. Nobody knows. And who knew that we would become the experts? When you see a baby, especially one that has been in your care for a long time, that has been off the charts in withdrawal. And you've done everything you possibly can. You finally get this baby acting like a normal baby. And then he smiles at you. And to know that you've made a difference in a mother's life. I mean, that will carry you through the darkest times knowing that my gosh, we did this. We did this. Now you can ask me the hard question. What did you feel like when I was born? When you were born. Actually didn't feel anything. I was 16 and I was a kid. I didn't know what I was doing. So when I took you home, I didn't know how to feel. I made a bad choice according to everybody. I was just like all the rest of them. I don't know what the rest of them means, but I know what it felt like. Like I didn't deserve to feel the way women who do the right things do. Because why would you celebrate someone making such a poor choice? So I didn't know what to feel. So I found nothing. And I just took care of you. I did what I was supposed to do until one day, I realized that I couldn't believe what people told me about myself or about those people like me. This is my baby and I love him and I can feel something. It's not a fairy tale. It's not a failure. It's just a process. And now we're here 16 years later. What are your dreams for me? My dream for you, Gregory, is that you become a good person and not a nice person. That's not a deep quality to me. Niceness is mediocrity. I want you to not be afraid to be afraid. But mostly I want you to be better than me. When I was little, I was always looking for someone to look up to, but it's always been right in front of me. You're just the greatest person that I ever know and I just want to be like you."
92,afearstrippedbare.wav," My mother liked to drink tea in the afternoon when the weight of the day had sunk in and the heat was still in heavy. This was in her walled in backyard in Tehran in the early 1980s after the Iranian revolution had changed everything. My parents were doctors and under the Shah, they and my older brothers had enjoyed the kind of privileged life such positions would normally afford. Frequent trips abroad and nice house with a swimming pool, other luxuries. But in the years right after I was born, when the Islamic government came to power, our foreign travel ceased, our swimming pool was drained. The hall was forbidden, though my parents kept it hidden in sugar jars. And despite having friendships that stretched back decades, my parents no longer knew whom they could trust. On those oppressively hot afternoons, my mother used to take her glass of tea, place two sugar cubes delicately between her lips and sit in the garden while I played with my toys in her empty pool as if it were a giant concrete playpin. She sat on the ledge and slowly unbuttoned her shirt, let it slip from her shoulders and allowed her skirt to fall loose. Baba our cook was blind and Nabahan my nanny was asleep by this hour so my mother would take her time to address. Just steps away on the other side of the wall, the pasta ronstood guard, their Russian supplied AK-47s strapped on their backs. My mother had reason to fear them. They had raided our home many times already, looking for liquor or other illegal comforts of our previous life. Men had been whisked away and imprisoned and brutalized for the slightest transgressions, like wearing lipstick or being improperly dressed. Despite this, she seemed boldly unafraid as she lounged half naked in the garden with her tea, dreaming of a far away place. Her rebellions were daily but covert. She did not raise her voice against the Iranian government or cake make up onto her face. She did not protest at rallies or burned flags. She simply wore no clothes underneath her hijab. In silent but nevertheless risky descent. An acknowledgement that her femaleness, her nakedness, was her most dangerous weapon. Years later, when my family was nestled safely in the Maryland suburbs, I always meant to ask her about her ritual. If I had, I imagined she would have simply answered with a twinkle in her eye that the heat was stifling. I respected my mother. Like any immigrant child, I knew my parents had sacrificed and worked hard for our material possessions. I was told of a land where women had to cover themselves, where they couldn't play soccer, where there were no girl scouts. I figured on some level that my mother hated Iran. It had become after all a country that she could not have imagined. While women used to get in trouble for wearing the hijab to school under the shawl, they then received lashings and beatings for not wearing them properly under the Islamic government. The country swung from one side of the religious pendulum to the other, or perhaps the clock just stopped working. All I knew was that my parents had left their homeland at my mother's insistence, that our flight must have been driven by hatred and that she was fearless to drag her family across the world. Yet while many in the West hated Iran, I continued to love the only home I had ever known. I had learned to speak on its shores, taken my first steps on its soil. How could I turn my back? The issues for me were not political, but internal and cultural. I was bitterly angry at the government and the clerics, but I felt remorse for Iran's people. And as things fell apart there, my sadness was palpable. But having spent only the first five years of my life in Tehran, I had trouble parsing fact from fantasy. While I remembered clearly the ritual of those backyard afternoons with my mother and powerful moments like learning Farsi in preschool and being punished if I refused to scream with my classmates' death to America, I often did not know if other memories were real or plucked from the nightly news. I did not know what Iran was or what it represented. For me, it was an unintelligible jumble of emotions from shame and resentment to love and sadness. It was like being in an abusive relationship with someone you can neither love nor leave. So I mourned on one side of the ocean while the country we fled struggled on the other. People mocked Iran and called me an enabler whenever I said anything positive. I cooked Persian food in my kitchen, savored the taste, but then spent hours scrubbing pants angrily. I did not know what Iran was anymore. It wouldn't even let me in. At home my parents were silent on this subject. Did they not miss anything about their homeland or its people? In school, the other students taunted me for my foreign name and lamb-based lunches. I made the mistake of telling them I was from Iran and the ridicule. The camel jokes and the seventh grade slurs never ended. I wished I were Russian or even Iraqi, those children were left alone. That my mother said nothing. There were no more harrowing tales of where we came from, only the common refrain that you loved the country where you pay your taxes. And so she laced my jet-black hair in pigtails with ribbons and trimmed back my unibrow and said, you are an American. And for a second, I believed her. As I saw the shadow of my grandmother, saying her prayers in her living room. But what did it mean to be an American? And why did my mother feel such an urgent need to remind me of a daily? Years later, when my mother was ravaged by cancer at 55, she was confused for the last few days of her life. And for the first time, spoke candidly to me about her past. She relived whole days, but she didn't even know who I was. At one point, I had to introduce myself as Susan. She seemed frantic. Oh, I have a daughter named Susan. I'll help you. And then she pulled me close and told me to cover up that the pasta don were coming, that I should clean off my nail polish. She took a blanket off of the bed that we had brought into our family room and threw it at me with considerable strength. Hurry, hurry, she exclaimed. They always take the young ones first. She grabbed a comforter and wrapped it around her head, which only had a few gray hairs remaining. The chemotherapy had taken the rest. I told her that we were living in America, that we were safe. She scoffed at me, asking why we would ever leave Iran. It was, after all, home. I shouldn't have argued with her. We knew she could be just days from death. As it turned out, she had only hours left. She had left the hospital to die at home in our care. But my anger got the better of me. I threw down the blanket and yanked the comforter off of her. We are safe. We live in America. She burrowed her head underneath the pillow. In her mind, she was still in Iran. But she was not bold, not defiant. She was terrified. In the course of her five-year battle with cancer, I felt that we had arrived at our lowest point. The woman I had always revered was now quarantined to a bed in our family room. Reliving a fear I'd been too young to share. All of my anger at the cancer and our missed opportunities had come out in my shouted at monashments. But when I saw her there, her head underneath the pillow I told her she was right. I covered myself in the blanket and we wrapped her in the comforter. I took a scar from the hall closet and framed her face. And we sat there. In our air-conditioned family room in the suburbs of Baltimore, waiting for the positive front. My mother did not know where she was or who I was. But what most saddened me wasn't that she had forgotten our home or me. I was less disturbed, in fact, by what she had forgotten than by what she had remembered. She had been brave all those years ago, yes. But she had hardly been without fear, then or no. And if her daily reminder was an affirmation of who we had become or of who she imagined us to be, it also must have been a way to quash the fear that regularly bubbled up inside of her. Suddenly, she looked at me, asked if Nubahon was asleep and slipped off her headscarf. She asked for a glass of tea as she heard the calls to prayer. And I sat there in her house on a street in Maryland and I heard the calls with her as I slipped off my blanket and then buttoned my shirt. Don't be afraid, she said. If you lose your entire self, you'll never get it back. Find yourself of who you are. I broke up with the run right then and there. My mother died that night, I suppose. She would have said that the heat finally caught her. And her eulogy I grappled with what to say. My story of her had changed. I didn't know the frightened woman I saw at the end, yet that must have been a large part of who she was. My mother had not left her unbehind. She had brought it with her along with the fear. And now she was gone and I had never asked her about any of it. Instead I had created a myth. And I had repeated her affirmation. We live in America instead of asking a question. I had seen what I wanted to see in a woman I will never see again. In the end, I merely clims the truth in a moment of confusion. I am 30 years old now and my mother would have been 63. I really talk about her, but I remember her every day. She is gone, yet I have brought her with me. I only wish I had known her better."
93,leavingbaghdad.wav," I was in a van on my way to school driving through the center of Baghdad. It's one of these vans that has a row of seats behind the driver where you sit backward with your back to the driver looking out at the back of the van. I remember I was sitting behind the driver and in front of me was my friend. She used to study English literature so she and I were speaking in English to practice. As we passed the children hospital all of a sudden I felt a wave of heat followed by an incredible explosion. The force of the explosion sent people flying from their seats. My friend jumped on me and hugged me. I put my arms around her as she cried but my eyes were just fixed on the explosion. The fire and the smoke behind us. I remember seeing a girl coming out from behind the smoke trying to run away. Our driver sped away trying to get to safety not knowing if another explosion is coming. We were just five minutes away from school. And I wasn't a shock. I couldn't believe that someone just drove a car bomb into the children hospital. I mean how evil can you be to do something like that? I grew up in Baghdad, Iraq and car bombs were on every day occurrence after 2003. My 25 minutes right to school took two hours because of the many and many checkpoints in the city. We kind of got used to it but we weren't happy. My mom would hug us and kiss us every day before we left for school because she know this might be her last hug or kiss. I always told myself that I should focus on school and get my degree and tomorrow is going to be better than today hoping to see an end to the Sunni and Shia civil war and to see a strong Iraqi military defeat al-Qaeda. Once I graduated I got a job and I had to cross town to get to this job. But after all the news of the sectarian killings and kidnappings, one morning my mom said the salary this job paid wasn't worth the cost of the risk making that journey posed. So my only choice was to leave Baghdad. On Thursday, November 23rd of 2006, I kissed my mom and siblings goodbye. I didn't cry because I almost never cried. What my mom was asking me to be careful and take care of myself. And she hugged me tight and her eyes start tearing. I wiped her tears and I told her, I'll be okay. I'll be fine and I'll come visit. But she said don't. I'm okay with you being away in a life better than you be close and always in danger. Then my dad takes me to Baghdad airport and as I was trying to drag my heavy suitcase, I was wondering why wasn't so heavy and that's when it hit me. My mom knew I'm not coming back to Baghdad so she started with everything I owned. I arrived in Kurdistan state in Northern Iraq and I managed to get a job and every day after work I would go and sit by the square and just watch people walking after sunset. Cars driving after sunset. I remember watching the colors of the traffic light because they were actually working. In Baghdad we had 6 p.m. curfew, no one was out that sunset. I never sat out that sunset. People here live normally without the fear of an ID or a car bomb that would take their lives in a second. I would just sit and enjoy the peace. But I wasn't very happy because I kept thinking about my family back home and their safety. Later I got a job offer to work for the US military as translator. And my first challenge as translator was the American accent. In Iraq we studied English from elementary school but we studied the Queen British English. So there were so many words that I couldn't understand because Americans when they speak they swallow letters. One time a soldier asked me, do you want to water bottle? I was like what? He was like water bottle. I was like what? What is water bottle? Because I couldn't hear the teas just the ours. And he's like this. I was like oh, how about a Vulta? All the time when I worked for a unit from Mississippi after working for four units from the North and Midwest. And I'm like oh my god. That's like a whole new language. I don't remember I ever said the word come again. Say again. As much as I said it to them. Being translator I would be translating paperwork documents in meeting with Iraqi police, Iraqi military, local mayors, leaders with top US military commanders. And other times, being a soldier and Iraqi local labor. And it helped me I learned a lot about the soldiers I worked with. It also kind of made me feel kind of living like a soldier without a weapon. And those soldiers I worked with they were my new family on base. Even though it was dangerous but for me it was safe because I was surrounded by many armed soldiers. So if someone was shooting at us they would shoot back. I felt protected. So after a year from being gone I really missed my family. And I wanted I asked to go on vacation to see them during Christmas and New Year. And so I go down to Baghdad. I spend great time with my mother, with my siblings, my dad. One evening I took a two mile walk to a nearby restaurant. After I ate I was feeling a bit lazy and full. And the sun was setting so I decided to take the bus. And Baghdad most buses are those 10 passenger vans and one pulled over to pick me up. The van was empty so I sat in the front passenger seat. The driver was listening to really loud music. I didn't care for that. I told him what I needed to get off. And when we got to my stop he didn't stop. So I told him hey you missed my stop but you can drop me off here. I'll walk back. And he said oh I'm sorry I was distracted by the loud music I'll turn around. And I was like it's okay you can drop me off here I'll walk. And he said no no he insisted on turn around. So I was like okay. At the end of the street he turned left and instead of turn around and then he took the highway ramp. And I'm like where you did not turn around where we going. And that's when he gave me the evil face and said you'll know once we get there. With no speed limits on the highway he was driving at least 100 mile per hour or even more. My heartbeat started to increase to the point I felt I can hear it. I can feel it's shaken. And you know and I have no idea what to do or what's going to happen. And living in Baghdad you know you probably would hear about a kidnapping almost every day in the news but they never tell you what happened or what to do if this happened to you. So I had no idea what to do. I looked at him and I saw his gun in his hand and I was like oh my god I was so afraid that he knew about me working for the US military because then I'll be beheaded no matter what. I thought of hitting him like what Tom Cruise or Jack Power would do but in the movie the lead actor always survived because it's a movie. And reality at terrorist would just put a bullet in my head or simply cry the vanning kill both of us. At that time the Sun will set and all I can think of is am I going to see another day? Am I going to see my family again? Am I going to see my mom? And at that point I just wished if I just stayed home and spent more time with them. Soon he exits the highway and his speed goes down. He was still driving faster than he should but slower than he was on the freeway. All of a sudden I see and hear by checkpoint on my right and a voice inside of me said if you don't survive this now you might not survive it at all. It was now or never. And without thinking I opened the door and I screamed the words help me but I wasn't able to know if they heard or saw me. And again that voice said the pain of the jump is nothing compared to the pain of being terrified until they behead you. And without thinking the next thing I knew I was on the ground and all I can remember is me getting up and and run. I don't remember if I rolled. I don't remember feeling any pain. I just ran. I ran for my life. I make it to the checkpoint and that's what I felt all the pain from the jump and thank God I didn't break any bones. And I fell on the ground and the two soldiers rushed to help me asking what happened what happened. All I could do is pointing to the street. I couldn't even I couldn't take my breath to even speak but I have made it. I've survived. Later the police escorts me home and my mom was crying but at the same time she was happy that I'm alive. But we knew I couldn't stay. I left back that early the next morning going back to the army base. No one will be years before I ever returned. In July of 2009 I got my special immigrant visa. It's a program that was set for Iraqi translators and their families to come to America because once you worked for the US military you will forever be al-Qaeda target. I was able to come here and my family followed me and my mom was the most excited because now we can all live in one country in peace. I got my citizenship. I was very happy or excited to live my American dream. I enrolled in the State University to get my master's degree. And life was going well for me. But even though I was happy with my life I felt something is missing. Every time I see a post on Facebook from one of my soldiers friend that I worked with in Iraq I feel that I should be with them. I was afraid of losing my new safe home, America, like I lost back there. In back that I was weak. I couldn't belong to an organization or an entity to help me stay and defend my city. But in America I'm strong. And today I'm an sergeant in the Army National Guard because I can belong to an organization that can prepare me to defend my adopted country and do my part as a citizen. Because I know how it feels living on the terrorism. And I don't want to ever experience that again."
94,whyimustspeakoutaboutclimatechange.wav," What do I know that would cause me a reticent Midwestern scientist to get myself arrested in front of the White House protesting? And what would you do if you knew what I know? Let's start with how I got to this point. I was lucky to grow up at a time when it was not difficult for the child of a tenant farmer to make his way to the state university. And I was really lucky to go to the University of Iowa where I could study under Professor James Van Allen who built instruments for the first U.S. satellites. Professor Van Allen told me about observations of Venus that there was intense microwave radiation. Did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere or was Venus extremely hot? The right answer, confirmed by the Soviet-Venera spacecraft, was that Venus was very hot, 900 degrees Fahrenheit. And it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere. I was fortunate to join NASA and successfully propose an experiment to fly to Venus. Our instrument took this image of the veil of Venus, which turned out to be a smog of sulfuric acid. But while our instrument was being built, I became involved in calculations of the greenhouse effect here on Earth because we realized that our atmospheric composition was changing. Eventually, I resigned as principal investigator on our Venus experiment because a planet changing before our eyes is more interesting and important. It changes will affect all humanity. The greenhouse effect had been well understood for more than a century. British physicist John Tindall in the 1850s made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation, which is heat. And he showed that gases such as CO2 absorb heat, thus acting like a blanket, warming Earth's surface. I worked with other scientists to analyze Earth climate observations. In 1981, we published an article in Science Magazine concluding that observed warming of 0.4 degrees Celsius in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing CO2. That Earth would likely warm in the 1980s, and warming would exceed the noise level of random weather by the end of the century. We also said that the 21st century would see shifting climate zones, creation of drought prone regions in North America and Asia, erosion of ice sheets, rising sea levels, and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage. All of these impacts have since either happened or are now well underway. That paper was reported on the front page of the New York Times and led to me testifying to Congress in the 1980s. Testimony in which I emphasized that global warming increases both extremes of the Earth's water cycle. Heat waves and droughts on one hand directly from the warming, but also because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor with its latent energy, rainfall will become in more extreme events. There will be stronger storms and greater flooding. Global warming, hoopla, became time-consuming and distracted me from doing science, partly because I had complained that the White House altered my testimony. I decided to go back to strictly doing science and leave the communication to others. By 15 years later, evidence of global warming was much stronger. Most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts. I had the privilege to speak twice to the president's climate task force, but energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels. By then we had two grandchildren, Sophie and Connor. I decided that I did not want them in the future to say, Opa understood what was happening but he didn't make it clear. So I decided to give a public talk criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy. I gave the talk at the University of Iowa in 2004 and at the 2005 meeting of the American Geophysical Union. This led to calls from the White House to NASA headquarters and I was told that I could not give any talks or speak with the media without prior explicit approval by NASA headquarters. After I informed the New York Times about these restrictions, NASA was forced to end the censorship, but there were consequences. I had been using the first line of the NASA mission statement to understand and protect the home planet to justify my talks. Soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted, never to appear again. For the next few years I was drawn more and more into trying to communicate the urgency of a change in energy policies while still researching the physics of climate change. Let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics. First from Earth's energy balance and second from Earth's climate history. Adding CO2 to the air is like throwing another blanket on the bed. It reduces Earth's heat radiation to space so there is a temporary energy imbalance. More energy is coming in than going out until Earth warms up enough to again radiate to space as much energy as it absorbs from the sun. So the key quantity is Earth's energy imbalance. Is there more energy coming in than going out? If so, more warming is in the pipeline. It will occur without adding any more greenhouse gases. Now finally we can measure Earth's energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in Earth's heat reservoirs. The biggest reservoir of the ocean was the least well measured until more than 3,000 argo floats were distributed around the world's ocean. These floats reveal that the upper half of the ocean is gaining heat at a substantial rate. The deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate and energy is going into the net melting of ice all around the planet and the land to depths of tens of meters is also warming. The total energy imbalance now is about 6 tenths of a watt per square meter. That may not sound like much but when added up over the whole world it's enormous. It's about 20 times greater than the rate of energy used by all of humanity. It's equivalent to exploding 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year. That's how much extra energy Earth is gaining each day. This imbalance if we want to stabilize climate means that we must reduce CO2 from 391 ppm parts per million back to 350 ppm. That is the change needed to restore energy balance and prevent further warming. Climate change deniers argue that the sun is the main cause of climate change but the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum in the record when the sun's energy reaching Earth was leased. Yet, there was more energy coming in than going out. This shows that the effect of the sun's variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gases mainly from burning fossil fuels. Now consider Earth's climate history. These curves for global temperature, atmospheric CO2 and sea level were derived from ocean cores and Antarctic ice cores, from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year, over 800,000 years forming a two-mile thick ice sheet. As you see there is a high correlation between temperature CO2 and sea level. Careful examination shows that the temperature changes slightly lead the CO2 changes by a few centuries. Climate change deniers like to use this fact to confuse and trick the public by saying, look, the temperature causes CO2 to change, not vice versa, but that lag is exactly what is expected. Small changes in Earth's orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the distribution of sunlight on Earth. When there is more sunlight at high latitudes in summer, ice sheets melt. Shrinking ice sheets make the planet darker, so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer. A warmer ocean releases CO2 just as a warm Coca-Cola does, and more CO2 causes more warming. So CO2, methane and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change, causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge, even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing. The important point is that the same amplifying feedbacks will occur today. The physics does not change. As Earth warms now because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere, ice will melt, and CO2 and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost, while we can't say exactly how fast these amplifying feedbacks will occur, it is certain they will occur unless we stop the warming. There is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning. Precise measurements by grace, the gravity satellite, reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica are now losing mass, several hundred cubic kilometers per year, and the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago. Methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost. What sea level rise can we look forward to? The last time CO2 was 390 ppm today's value, sea level was higher by at least 15 meters, 50 feet, where your city now would be underwater. Most estimates are that this century we will get at least one meter. I think it will be more if we keep burning fossil fuels perhaps even five meters, which is 18 feet. This century or shortly thereafter. The important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity's control. Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries. There would be no stable shoreline. The economic consequences are almost unthinkable, hundreds of new Orleans-like devastations around the world. What may be more reprehensible if climate denial continues is extermination of species. The monarch butterfly could be one of the 28-50% of all species that the intergovernmental panel on climate change. Estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business as usual fossil fuel use. Global warming is already affecting people. The Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico, heat wave and drought last year, Moscow the year before and Europe in 2003 were all exceptional events, more than three standard deviations outside the norm. 50 years ago, such anomalies covered only two to three tenths of one percent of the land area. In recent years, because of global warming, they now cover about 10 percent, an increase by a factor of 25 to 50. So we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe Texas and Moscow heat waves were not natural, they were caused by global warming. An important impact, if global warming continues, will be on the bread basket of our nation and the world, the Midwest and Great Plains, which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts, worse than the dust bowl, within just a few decades, if we let global warming continue. How did I get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate, giving talks in ten countries, getting arrested, burning up at the vacation time that I had accumulated over 30 years? More grandchildren helped me along. Jake is a super positive, enthusiastic boy. Here at age two and a half years, he thinks he can protect his two and a half day old little sister. It would be immoral to leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control. Now, the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it. With a simple, honest approach of a gradually rising carbon fee, collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed 100 percent electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis, with the government not keeping one dime. Most people would get more in the monthly dividend than they pay an increased prices. This fee and dividend would stimulate the economy and innovations, creating millions of jobs. It is the principle requirement for moving us rapidly to a clean energy future. Several top economists are co-authors on this proposition. Jim DePesso, a Republicans for Environmental Protection, describes it thusly. Current market-based does not enlarge government leaves energy decisions to individual choices, sounds like a conservative climate plan. But instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions to make fossil fuels pay their true cost to society, our governments are forcing the public to subsidize fossil fuels by 400 to 500 billion dollars per year worldwide. Thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel, mountain top removal, long wall mining, fracking, tar sands, tar shell, deep ocean, Arctic drilling. This path, if continued, guarantees that we will pass tipping points, leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future generations. A large fraction of species will be committed to extinction, and increasing intensity of droughts and floods will severely impact bread baskets of the world, causing massive famines and economic decline. Imagine a giant asteroid on a direct collision course with Earth. That is the equivalent of what we face now. But we did their taking no action to divert the asteroid, even though the longer we wait, the more difficult and expensive it becomes. If we had started in 2005, it would have required emission reductions of 3% per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabilize climate this century. If we start next year, it is 6% per year. If we wait 10 years, it is 15% per year, extremely difficult and expensive, perhaps impossible. But we aren't even starting. So now you know what I know that is moving me to sound this alarm. Clearly, I haven't got this message across. The science is clear. I need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions more effectively. We owe it to our children and grandchildren. Thank you."
95,thepostmanalwayscalls.wav," When I was 11 years old, I took a train from the west of England to where my mother lived, 200 miles for the summer holidays. And I wasn't looking forward to the summer holidays because there were no children there that I knew in the place where my mother lived and usually could invite a friend from school to come, but this time I didn't have anybody. The one thing that I really, really look forward to that summer, every summer, was that I could go swimming. I loved to go swimming and there was a swimming pool in the town where my mother lived in Rochester. That was, it was rather grim, it was a sort of large bleak looking swimming pool with just grubby little changing rooms and a small cafe that sold only cheese sandwiches and hot mugs of tea. But I loved it, I loved it so much. I could go there to the swimming pool and swim all day and eat my cheese sandwich and cup of tea and then come home. So that was my plan for the summer and as soon as I got home I started working on getting some money to go swimming because it cost money to go swimming. I think it was about a shilling at that time along with the cheese sandwich and I first of all my mother lived with her partner, Uncle Vic, who was a doctor and my mother was a sort of social person. I didn't see very much of her, she wasn't very interested in children. But Uncle Vic was sort of the stalwart of the family and he was quite strict. But he was the source of money and I went to him as soon as I needed to and said, please could I have some money to go swimming? He said, well Elizabeth, you know you're 11 years old. I just think it's time for you to start caring about other people, doing something for other people, not just playing and swimming. Just do something for other people and I said, well what can I do for other people? And he said, well, you know I have patients, I have an old lady for instance who really lives alone and is quite lonely and she would love to have a little girl come visit her and I said no, I don't want to visit an old lady and I'm going to spend the summer visiting old ladies. Now the next source of income was my mother's nanny, Auntie Mae. She lived in the same town, she had taken care of my mother since she was a newborn infant and she had taken care of me a little bit too and she was rather like a grandmother and she was very kind to me and generous. So off I went to see Auntie Mae and I arrived at her house, she had a boarding house for working men and she was there in the kitchen and I loved to go there because she was a great cook and while I ate one of her Cornish pasties I said to her, aren't you Mae, could I have some money for swimming? And she said, you know Elizabeth, you're getting a bit old to go swimming every day, you're 11 years old. I think you should start doing things for other people. They're, what is she doing with Uncle Vic? Why? And I said, Auntie Mae, Uncle Vic wants me to go and spend the day with an old lady and not going to do things like that. And she said, well, look at that, see that jar on the windowsill there? Yes. She said, that jar is full of silver paper and I use the word silver paper meaning foil. That jar is full of silver paper and you know what it's for, no. It's, I'm saving up for a guide dog for a blind person. I said, well, how can you get a guide dog for a blind person with a jar of silver paper? She said, no, you can't get a guide dog for blind person with one jar of silver paper, but if hundreds and hundreds of people are saving their silver paper, their milk bottle tops, their chocolate wrappers, their cigarette wrappers soon, well, maybe in a few years, you could get enough silver paper together and redeem it and with the money you could buy a guide dog for a blind person. I thought, that's ridiculous. I mean how many years have I got? And I'm not going to do that. So I went home and that night I was reading the evening news. That was a national paper and it had a children's section and the children's section had a letter section and you could write a letter to the evening news and if you got the letter of the week, you would get five shillings. Five shillings was enough to go swimming five times, so I thought, okay, I'll write to the evening news and I'll win that five shilling. So I wrote to the evening news and I wrote, I'm a little girl. I'm a little girl, home for the holidays with no friends. And I decided to spend my entire holiday saving up silver paper. Another guide dog for the blind. And I sent it off and a couple of days later I looked in the paper and they printed my story, my letter, but it wasn't the letter of the week. So I didn't get the five shilling. So it was really, I was back to square one. No money, no swimming, nothing. So a couple of days later the doorbell rang, my mother and I went to the front door and there was a postman and he had a van and he said, does Miss Elizabeth live here? And my mother said, well, yes, my daughter Elizabeth. And he said, I've got some parcels for her. And oh, it wasn't even my birthday. So, and he bought it in this great big sack and he shot out all these brown paper parcels on the whole floor. And my mother said, what is this? And what have you done? What do you know what this is? And I said, no, because I'd completely forgotten about that letter because you know. And so we opened one of the parcels and silver paper poured out. And my mother said, what is this? And I said, oh, I know, you know I wrote a letter to the evening news about, you know, helping save up for a guide dog for the blind. They said, what? Well, this is ridiculous. I mean, you can't save up for a guide dog for the blind. I said, I know. Well, aren't you maize doing it? And I thought I'd do it too. And she said, well, I don't know if we can, I don't know what we're going to do about this. And the next van full of parcels came. And the whole hall was filled with mountains of brown paper parcels. And goodness, my mother said, I know what we can do. What we'll do is we'll call a local newspaper and we'll have them take over the whole business of the silver paper. And you know, we'd opened a few of these parcels and they were so sweet. And the whole road, what a wonderful little girl you are. And I thought, I am. Really. And my mother said, let's call the local newspaper. Let them take it over. They can store the silver paper until, you know, they redeem it. And then you can answer the letters. And you know, that seemed like a great idea. But the newspaper said, we want to do an article on the mis Elizabeth. And so my mother said, well, that's all right. Come on, do an article. And a reporter came and a photographer came and they took all the parcels of silver paper and poured them out onto the living room floor into a mountain and they sat a chair in the middle of it. They told me to put on my school uniform so that I looked like a very proper little girl. And I sat on the chair reading one of the letters with my mother behind me, feigning interest. And the article, I mean, this was a local paper, they didn't have much news. The article filled almost one half of a page. And the title was, the postman always calls it mis Elizabeth's door. And then I became really famous in Rochester. Because everybody knew me as the little girl who was saving up for a guide dog for the blind all by herself. So the parcels came, then the newspaper came and picked them up. And the parcels were coming from everywhere. They were coming from the Commonwealth. They were coming from Australia and New Zealand and Canada were ever English people had strayed and still had relatives here in England and their relatives sent them the newspapers. And you know I spent the entire summer writing thank you letters. I never went swimming. Luckily the summer came to an end. And I left to go back to boarding school. And all the letters were sent to me so I had to do all my school work and all the thank you very much for the silver paper letters. One chap offered to make me a birthday cake and he did and it was wonderful. So there was money too but Uncle Vic kept a tight hold on the money because he thought I'd try to take it to go swimming. I don't know why he thought that. Anyway Christmas time came and it was time to go have the holidays again. I must say our house did smell like sour milk because some people didn't wash their milk bottle tops. It was a rancid. You know it's the only word for it. And my mother said you know you've got a there's a call from the local paper and you better call them and I called up the editor of the paper and I said this is Elizabeth the little girl who's saving this over paper. And he said you're not going to believe this Elizabeth but you have saved up enough silver paper to buy a guide dog for a blind person. Oh by myself. Along with the whole country. And you're to come up to London there's going to be a presentation at the society for the blind, the Royal Society for the blind and you will present a guide dog to a blind person. They said all right. They came and picked me up and they took me to the Royal Society and there was a really sweet little girl who was blind. I didn't even know that children were blind. And there was this lovely golden lab and I first of all they introduced me then they introduced Ellie the little girl and then we all hugged each other. The dog, Ellie, me, everybody cried. It was a very moving, very moving. All of that I went back home and my mother said all right this is it. No more silver paper. We can't have it coming in here anymore. This is what I want you to do. Right to the evening news. That was the original paper where I didn't win the five shillings. And I want you to write and tell them that you've got a guide dog and you don't want any more silver paper. So I wrote the evening news. Dear readers, I'm the little girl who wrote to you last year and said that I was saving up for a guide dog for a blind person. And I did. I saved up and we got a guide dog and we gave it to a blind person and it was a tremendous success and thank you everybody who sent me silver paper from wherever you live, Australia, New Zealand, all over England and please don't send any more. Please don't send any more because my mother doesn't like smell in the house. So I wrote the letter and guess what? My letter wasn't just printed. It didn't win the letter of the week. It won the letter of the year. And the letter of the year won 50 pounds. 50 pounds. Enough to go swimming for the rest of my life."
96,onlyonewaytofindout.wav," I was three months pregnant with identical twin boys when my husband Ross and I learned that one of them had a fatal birth defect. Our son Thomas had anencephaly, which means that his skull and brain were not formed properly. And babies with this diagnosis typically die in utero or within minutes, hours, or days of being born. So this diagnosis was devastating and also confusing. I had never heard of this before. It didn't run in my family and I wondered, was it something I ate? Was it something I drank? Was it something I did? But then even if it was, why was one of them healthy? So I was wrestling with a lot of questions that would really never have an answer. And I had to make a piece with that and it was almost like having an annoying hum in the background. So six months later, the twins were born and they were both born alive. Thomas lived for six days and Calum was healthy. And Ross and I moved on the best that we could. We had a beautiful, healthy boy to raise. And we decided early on to tell Calum the truth about his brother and we have a few pictures of Thomas in our home. And it was a few years later that it seemed that Calum was starting to comprehend what we were telling him. And sometimes he said things that were sad and sometimes he said things that were kind of funny. We visit Thomas' grave a couple times a year and I remember one time we said to him, we're going to bring some flowers to put on Thomas' grave. And Calum picked up one of his little match box cars and says, I want to put this on on the grave too, which I thought was really sweet. And then once we were there, Calum said to me, is Thomas scared under there? Of course, I don't really know the answer to that. You know, I can pretend. So I just said to him, no, he's not scared. And then later on, we were sitting on the couch watching cartoons and Calum said to me, mommy, what is it like in heaven? Again, I don't really know. I'll do my best. So I just said, well, you know, it's a place. Some people think it's a place you go when you die. Some people don't believe it's there. And Calum interrupted me and he said, no, mommy, look it up on your phone. LAUGHTER So I was also curious about Thomas' afterlife, but in a totally different way, Ross and I decided to donate Thomas' organs to science. While his death was inevitable, we thought maybe it could be productive. We learned that because he would be too small at birth to donate for transplant, he would be a good candidate to donate for research. So we were able to donate four things. His liver, his cord blood, his cornea, which is the front of the eye and his retina, which is the back of the eye. And I was curious if these donations really made a difference. So later on, I was on a business trip in Boston. And I remembered that Thomas' cornea's went to a division of Harvard Medical School called the Scapins Eye Research Institute. And I took some advice from Calum and I looked it up on my phone. LAUGHTER And I saw that it was only a few miles from my hotel. And I thought to myself, I would love to visit this lab and learn more about where this donation went. Because I gave them a donation, but it wasn't just signing a check or giving a bag of clothes. You know, I gave them a gift of my child. At the same time, I signed the informed consent forms that state that I know that once I make this donation, I'm not going to get any more information about it. And I signed them anyway. I did that fully informed. So if they did not welcome me, I would understand where they were coming from. But I really thought, I think I have the right to visit this place. Anyway, I thought, you know, if they reject me, am I really emotionally ready for that? And what's that going to do to my grief if they reject me? But I called. And I explained to the receptionist. I said, I donated it by Sun's Eyes to your lab a few years ago. I'm in town for a couple of days. Is there any chance I can stop by for a 10 minute tour? And there was a long pause. And lucky for me, the receptionist was very compassionate. She didn't laugh or say it was weird, which it is a little weird. She said, I've never had this request before. I don't know who to transfer you to, but don't hang up, because I am going to find somebody for you. But don't hang up. So she connected me to someone in donor relations, which it was not organ donor relations. It was financial donor relations, but she knew how to give a tour. So we set up an appointment and the next day I showed up and she introduced me to one of the people who requests Cornia's, Dr. James Ziskey. He's a professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School. And I stood in his doorway, she explained who I was, and he was eating a whole food salad at his desk. And he stood up and he thanked me for the donation and he shook my hand. And he said, do you have any questions for me? And I was so emotional meeting him. I said, how many Cornia's do you request in a year? And he said, my lab requests about 10 a year. We would request more, but they're hard to get. And infant eyes are like gold to us. And my heart was just in my throat and I could barely choke out the words and I said, could you tell me why? And he said, well, infant eyes, first of all, they're unusual because most of us are older when we die and that's when you donate your eyes. But also infant eyes have the potential to regenerate in the lab. And if you don't mind me asking, how long ago did your son die? And I said about two years ago and he said, we're likely still studying your son's eye cells right now and they're probably in this lab right now. So, after the tour concluded, my tour guide said to me, she said, I'll never forget you and please keep in touch with me. And I felt something and he started to change. And I felt that my son had found his place in the world and that place was Harvard. So my son got into Harvard and I'm now an Ivy League mom. But I also sort of got the bug and I thought, you know, maybe I could visit these three other places too. You know, would they be as nice to me as the Harvard people were? I would go to the library and I would go to the library and I would go to the library and I would go to the library and I would go to the library and I would go to the library and I would return to life with a bug living over there and you know, I used to think, could I kill one man? Can wechuckling the pun, can we hug one man? Are we seeing Mr. Ceiladek this before? Can we guess who's immigration is this person? Is it a proliferous Singapore? The arrived Cave that I went to women's chega or there is a law team for immigrants. A krijum. And we met Prince Jacques Vanguard and they said that he did this. genome project. And he explained that the twins' blood was extremely valuable to them. He said he's studying a field called epigenetics. So while the twins' genes were the same because they were identical twins, there's a field called epigenetics that explains why genes turn themselves on and off. So even though they're identical, these twins could be different. And this blood helped them to establish a baseline. And they also analyzed the blood and produced a poster for a conference and they gave us a copy. We then drove down the street to Cidonet, which is the place that got Thomas's liver. And we met the president and about eight members of staff. And we even met the woman who held Thomas's liver in her hands. They also explained to us that Thomas's liver was used in a six liver study to determine the best temperature to freeze infant liver cells for a life-saving therapy. And they also said that we were the only donor family that had ever visited before. A few years later, I set up the final appointment in Philadelphia and Ross Kalmanai went to the University of Pennsylvania. That's where we met the researcher that got Thomas's retinas. And she explained that she was studying retinoblastoma, which is a deadly cancer of the retina. And she said that she had been waiting six years for a sample like Thomas's. And it was so precious to her that she had saved some of it. In five years later, she still had some in her freezer and did we want to see it? Yes, we did. She then gave Kalman a pen t-shirt and she offered him an internship. So I had thought when we made this donation in the abstract and in a generic sense that this is a nice thing to do. But I was really amazed and blown away when I met the researchers and they told me specifically what they were doing with each donation. And I had the feeling of grief that I had started to turn into pride and I felt that Thomas was introducing us to his colleagues and his co-workers. And he was introducing me to people that I never would have met. And he'd been taking me to places that I never would have been, including here tonight. And the humming that I felt in the back of my mind stopped. Recently Ross Kalman went to Philadelphia to accept an award from the National Disease Research Interchange for Advocacy. And we went on stage and Kalman accepted this award and he was so proud. I took the opportunity to ask him a question and I said, do you know why we're accepting this award? And he said, for helping people. So I know that as he grows older, there will be more questions, tough questions. And I'm going to have to teach him that sometimes in life there are questions that are important but you'll still never get the answer. But it's always worth a try and you never know until you ask. Thank you."
97,swimmingwithastronauts.wav," A couple of weeks after I got my phone call from NASA that I was selected to be an astronaut, my information packet came in the mail. And the cover letter had a paragraph at the beginning that said, congratulations. And then there was the second paragraph and it said, practice your swimming. It will be required to pass a swim test in order to go to water survival training with the United States Navy and Pensacola. And I could not believe this because after years of applications and interviews and medical examinations from head to toe and an extensive background check, never once than anyone ever think to ask, do you know how to swim? And if they did, my answer would have been not really. Although I grew up on Long Island and was surrounded by water my entire life, I didn't like swimming and I completely hated the water. I was a skinny little kid who was always freezing when I got wet and I didn't like having my head under the water. I couldn't breathe. I didn't like having chlorine in my eyes. When I would go to a pool party, I would go on my tippy toes just so my head was exposed and pretend like I was having a good time. Now the one thing that I hated and avoided my entire life had now become the one thing that I had to do well and the one thing that was going to stand between me and my dream of flying in space. I wasn't going to let that stop me. I had the summer to get ready. I took my kids to the pool every day and I swam and I practiced and I practiced and I practiced. At the end of that summer I reported for duty at the Johnson Space Center, a much better swimmer but still very nervous about what I was going to have to do there. I reported there with 43 other new astronauts but we weren't really astronauts yet. We were astronaut candidates or as our senior astronauts called us, Ascans. We were all 44 new Ascans. In our initial briefing they told us how we could grow up to be astronauts and they gave us a list of things that we were going to be doing over the next two years. All the different examinations and qualifications that we would have to get in order to do that. The very first test we were going to have was the swim test. How was like, really? Can't we have like a math quiz or physics test? Then the briefer went on and said, okay, all the strong swimmers in his class raise your hand and a couple of the military people raised their hand. We had a Navy diver raise their hand and then he asked, okay, all the weak swimmers raise your hands and be honest. And I sheepersly raised my hand along with a couple other egg head PhDs. And he said, great, you strong swimmers and you weak swimmers this weekend, you're going to work together and you strong swimmers are going to get these weak swimmers ready to pass the test. That's exactly what we did. We showed up that next week, all 44 of us, to take this test in full gear. Flight suit, boots and helmet. And the feeling that day was everyone was going to pass. We were not going to leave that pool until everyone passed. And we got in the water and we did our long distance swim, demonstrating all the survival strokes that we needed to show. We did a lap under water. We demonstrated that we could save each other, do a rescue swim. We drowned proof, the minutes we got on our back with only our mouth exposed, bringing in sips of air to fill our lungs so we get buoyancy on the water. And then after you were good and tired from all that, it was time to tread, tread water. And in the last few minutes of that tread, they blew a whistle and you had to bring your hands out of the water. And if your hands went underneath the water, you failed and you had to do the whole test over again. And as I'm treading for dear life with my hands out of the water, those last few minutes, I'm looking around at my new classmates, I look from like bank and don't see them anymore. But I see his hands. They didn't say anything about your head being out of the water. They only said your hands had to be out of the water. And by golly, Mike was not going to let his hands go under that water. And I realized just how determined this group of people was, these people that I had now become classmates with, future astronauts with, every one of us passed. Everyone passed that test. And a few weeks later, we flew down to Naval Air Station, Pensacola, the home of naval aviation. And for a kid who dreamt about being an astronaut and watched the right stuff a thousand times and read that book about a hundred times, I was in heaven. There were F-18s with Blue Angels in him screaming overhead. There were young Navy and Marine recruits exercising and running all over the place. And then there was us. And we were there to be trained to eject out of a high performance aircraft, be able to work our parachute and our survival gear, and surviving the water long enough for someone to come and get us. Now this is something that I would never dream of doing in a million years. And I found out how the Navy was going to get us ready to do this. You don't jump out of the plane the first day. What you do is you take it step by step and they build you up, inch by inch, baby steps until you're ready to do the big exercise at the end of the week. So what we started to do was get by the end of the pool, just on the edge of the pool and jump in. And then once you got that down, you went on a platform about a foot off the water and you jumped from there and you got progressively higher. And then they taught us how to go through our checklist. Once we ejected from the aircraft, make sure your canopy was good. You needed a good canopy above your head and if you didn't have one they told you what to do to fix it. And then you went through all your other checks. Make sure your mask is off. Your visor is up. Deploy your seat kit with all your survival gear. And then make sure, most important, one of the most important things for me anyway, was that your LPU, your life-preserver unit, was inflated because that's what's going to keep you floating when you hit the water. And then pull three lines, a three line jettison which allows you to steer the parachute. And after you got into the water, they taught us how to get away from the parachute and how to release from it because I could fill with water and take you to the bottom of the ocean. We did this step by step and the graduation exercise came at the end of that week. And what that was was going to be a power sale above the Gulf where we were going to release from the boat, enter the water, get out, get into a raft, signal for help and they would come pick us up and we had to do that twice. And if you did that twice successfully, you passed the water survival course. That Friday came and I'm out on the Gulf of Mexico on a platform ship getting ready to be hooked up to a cable to be taken power sailing for this final exam. And my classmate right in front of me is Stephanie Wilson. Stephanie Wilson is about five foot two and weighs about a hundred pounds. And he Wilson is about the size of one of my legs. Stephanie starts marching in place. She gets a little tug from the boat, takes about a step and or she goes like Peter Pan. Okay. Then he hooked me up to the boat, to the line. And I'm really, really nervous because not only am I scared of the water, I am also afraid of heights. Yeah, I know let it out. An astronaut, an astronaut who's afraid of heights. I start marching in place just like they told me. And then I start walking and I'm getting pulled and then I start walking faster and then I start running. And then I start thinking this boat is not infinitely long. I get to the edge of the platform and I'm still moving my legs. I haven't gotten airborne yet. And I start going toward the ocean. And I plunge and belly flop about 20 feet and do a face plant into the water. And then the boat starts dragging me through the water. And as I'm trying to gas for air and look, I see this chief petty officer, our instructor in the back of that boat, signaling to me, telling me release from your shoot, release from your shoot. I release from the shoot just like she told me. Then they come and get me and my LPU, the thing that's supposed to save me, the lifesaver unit had popped on impact. They had a Navy doctor check me out and he turns to the chief petty officer and says he'll be okay. And she looks to me and says, that's good. You still got to do it twice, that didn't count. I get hooked up to the boat again. I start marching. I start running. I hit the edge of the boat again and here comes round two with the water. But this time I skim the water with my feet, my saline plates and I rise above the water. And then I get a signal from the chief petty officer, the green flags waving at me and that means three leaks from the boat and I do that. And then I go through my checklist. Canopy, visor, mask, seat kit, LPU, three line jettison and I steer myself down and I keep my eye on her eyes and her eyes and her eyes and let it come. Wait for it. Late for it. And I see the horizon coming up. My feet get a little bit wet. I release from my shoot. I do my survival exercise. They come get me and I have to do it one more time and I can pass. They hook me up again. I march, walk, run, drop. Don't get wet. Come up high. And I pause for a moment and I looked around. It was a beautiful day above the Gulf that day. I could see the coast of Florida. I could see the Atlantic Ocean and it hit me. What I was doing. What an extraordinary experience this had been. The skinny kid from Long Island was going through water survival training as an astronaut candidate soon to be astronaut hopefully with the United States Navy. And then I looked down at the boat and frantically the chief petty officers waving a flag. I release, do the whole routine again, land in the water and they come get me. And I had this great feeling of accomplishment. More than I ever had in my life. I had gone through some tough tests as an undergraduate at Columbia and almost killed me to get through my qualifying exam for my PhD at MIT and to complete my dissertation. But those things for some reason seemed doable. This was facing one of the greatest fears I had and I had to do this in order to achieve my dream of flying in space. I just felt like a superhero getting this done. And then I realized I had become a good swimmer. Over those months of practicing and going through the swim test and all these lessons and the Navy I had become a really good swimmer. I had swim goggles. I had a bathing suit. I could maybe do this for exercise for the rest of my life. Once that day over the Gulf of Mexico, 20 years ago I had never swim another lap."
98,whenmothersbullyback.wav," Once, I threw a playground ball at the head of a boy who was repeatedly dunking my young son underwater. Before I threw the ball, I shouted at him to stop, but he continued. I was at the other end of the pool, maybe a six-second swim away, but my five-year-old son was gasping and pleading, and the fastest way to make my point was to throw the ball. I played college baseball. I have a pretty good arm. I nailed the older boy in the back of the head, and he cried out, spun around furiously to face me. I'm pretty sure he wasn't expecting to see a mom in an unflattering swimsuit, but there I was. Despite the awkward silence on the pool deck, where family members of both boys sat forward in their lounge chairs, I felt no shame or regret. I felt triumphant. I felt empowered. If I'd had another ball within arms reach, I might well have thrown it too, for emphasis. A year or so later, my son was the victim of teasing at school. It was garden variety name-calling. Nothing extraordinary, just your generic first-grade flirtation with cruelty. But when the teacher informed me of it, I went internally ballistic. My son was a bit gloomy, though clearly not traumatized. When I asked him about it, he waved me off, seeming more troubled by my concern than by the incident itself. But of course, I was instantly and thoroughly unhinged. A switch flipped, and suddenly I was that crazy woman in the pool again. But where was my trusty playground ball? And how was I supposed to protect my son when I was absent from the scene of the crime? The consensus among family and friends was that I was overreacting. Had I really not anticipated that my child might be picked on every so often? That dunking and name-calling were part of the package? That kids might occasionally be, you know, jerks? Of course I had anticipated this. What I had not anticipated, what I had in fact been utterly unable to anticipate, was how those things would make me feel. This was not the first time that the intense emotions of motherhood had taken me by surprise. For the first several years of my son's life, I had been regularly astonished by moments of unbridled joy, moments so unlike anything I had known that each time I experienced one, his hand curling closed around my index finger, his light-up sneakers flashing at the end of the dark driveway, his bat finally connecting with the ball on the wobbly tee. I felt I was starting life over, stepping out of one life and into another as a brand new person. Now, in the wake of the bullying, I was feeling like a brand new person again. Unfortunately, that brand new person was a lunatic. I didn't want to physically harm my son's bullies. I just wanted to crush their spirits. I wanted them to feel tiny and powerless and stupid. I wanted them to cry sniveling tears in front of a crowd of jeering, joyful classmates. Walking my dog late at night, my conniving obscured by the neighborhood shadows, I concocted and dismissed dozens of outlandish plans, each with the approximate sophistication of a fifth grade Halloween prank. The main problem was that I simply couldn't figure out the logistics of my vigilanteism. If only I could be in a position to publicly humiliate the bullies, if only I had the kind of job that would make that possible. If I were a barber, I could give them terrible haircuts, setting them up as prime targets for other bullies. If I were a waitress, I could shake chili powder over their hamburgers, causing gagging and drooling, possibly even vomiting. Alas, I was a college professor. Short of mocking the cliched nature of their bullying, four eyes, seriously, is that the best you got punk? My prospects for retribution were slim. I also understood, even in my adult state, that to intervene might cause my son added humiliation. If I openly retaliated, I could be feeding the bullies of a fave of delicious, irresistible material. The target on my son's back would be seen from space. Baby needs his mom to fight his battles. The thought enraged me even further. Not only was my maternal protection undesired, it was also now a legitimate liability. Getting down this rabbit hole and acknowledging the intense satisfaction I got from these little revenge fantasies against seven-year-olds, got me thinking about the parameters of acceptable maternal behavior. Surely, I was not the first mother to have had these thoughts, but I couldn't recall many instances of people discussing this kind of rage openly. Not actual mothers, and not fictional mothers either. It struck me that, as enlightened as we are about some of the grey areas of human nature, other grey areas seem inherently off-limits. We are uncomfortable with mothers who are not easily definable, with good mothers who sometimes think bad thoughts, and even do bad things. In the movies, if a mother is going to be bad, then we want her to be really bad. Texas cheerleader mom bad. Joan Crawford wirehanger bad. Otherwise, we prefer fictional mothers to be gently flawed and efficiently redeemable. We want their mistakes to be caused by misunderstandings. They're shortcomings the results of a lack of confidence, like bringing store-bought cookies to the potluck and trying to pass them off as home bait. In fiction, wackiness is valued above all in the flawed mother, because pain caused by the wacky mother is not real pain, it's amusing, sit-compane, and, as such, does not last beyond the episode and leaves no scars on its victims. I think that, essentially, the same is true in real life. We are uncomfortable with mothers thinking horrible things, even under horrible circumstances. We don't want them to be cruel unless the cruelty is directed at someone who clearly deserves it. We are unnerved by maternal ugliness and malice and selfishness that can't be entirely justified or even worse, satisfyingly resolved. We don't want mothers to throw balls at children's heads, but we especially don't want mothers to want to throw a second ball for punishment after the threat has passed. My maternal instinct to protect my child in that swimming pool is forgivable. My maternal instinct for vengeance is not at all. Except this. My children, my son, and his younger sister love the story of me and the pool. They want to hear it again and again, relishing even the smallest details. What sound did the ball make when it hit the boy's head? Thwok! How far did it ricochet? Ten, maybe twelve feet. Did the boy ever try to dunk anyone again? Not on my watch. They laugh. They slap me high fives. They say, you're crazy! But they say it like a compliment. Like wildly overreacting is a good thing. So maybe it's just a hypothetical mother that we prefer to see exhibiting sound judgment and proper behavior. Maybe it's the idea of the good mother we hold in high regard. But in actuality, in the unflattering swimsuit of our own realities, we, at least as children, are happy to have a mother who loves us so much she will behave like a lunatic on our behalf. My personal lust for revenge against those first grade bullies didn't last long. At least not at that fever pitch. Life and parenthood quickly got more complicated because that's what life and parenthood do. This is the case with all of our children. The threats my son faced as a tween and teenage boy were nearly impossible to attribute to any particular individuals, and name calling became the least of my worries. Even dunking, now ten years past, seems almost quaint. The things that dunk our kids now are impervious to balls, no matter how true our aim. In retrospect, it was lovely to have those obvious villains, those specific names to curse, those clear bull's eyes. The dangers now are one that lurk in the shadows, shape-shifters, moving targets. I have no satisfying fantasies of defeating them. My son is now friends with his old tormentors. At fifteen, they call each other all sorts of terrible things. They are all bullies and they are all bullied. In no time, they will be men. In a year, they'll be driving cars. For now though, they still need me. I drive them to the movies. I pick them up from school in the rain. We get mocas at the Starbucks drive-through. They're pretty good kids, all of them. And the fact that I once wanted to make them cry makes me feel a little guilty. But not that guilty."
99,undertheinfluence.wav," In all honesty, I'm going to start by admitting that I sometimes lie. Occasionally, I'll include a lie in a story I'm telling if I think it'll make the story better. I don't do it to protect the innocent because I don't own any stories with the people in them are innocent. And I don't do it to be shocking either, though I admit to once telling a story where I exaggerated the length of my penis. In my own defense, I exaggerated down and not up. And I did it for the laugh. The story I'm telling you tonight does not have a lie in it, or many laughs for that matter. When I'm done telling you this story, you may think it's nothing but a lie. But I'd ask you to trust me on this. At the age of 19, I felt prey to a powerful and deeply corrupting influence. It dogged me for six years, costing me many a friend, and in the process bringing my family to ruin. It crippled me to such an extent that I have spent the intervening 15 years recovering from it. The influence I speak of is hope. Now, you should know at the get-go, there's nothing in my childhood to suggest I might find myself on such a wayward path as that. My parents loved me terribly. They taught me right from wrong. They taught me to be courageous in the face of bullies. They taught me patience and forgiveness. They taught me that love would see you through any misfortune. My trouble began on Independence Day, not the Independence Day, but my Independence Day. My Independence Day occurred on Memorial Day, 1982. That was the day I told my family I was gay. The act itself, mom, dad, I'm gay, was relatively unexceptional. In fact, it should have been more exceptional. And I've always sort of wished that it had been. However, subsequent events overshadowed it, and it pales by comparison. The subsequent events occurred in my absence, after the fact, as I was in my car driving back to college to take my final freshman exams. I remember being on the highway and thinking how, you know, I kind of expected my parents to freak out a little. And, you know, to my surprise, they had not freaked out. They'd been calm and cool and collected, oddly calm, cool and collected. But still, I was really happy as I drove back to school. Meanwhile, subsequent events were busy unfolding back home. My mother was going through the house where I grew up and was gathering together things I had made for her, a jewelry box when I was in 4-H, and a painting when I was 16, a box containing the letters that I'd written them from school, which I used to do every week. She was removing photographs from the walls and placing them in little piles around the house. And she was directing my father, who never dared not call her direction to take the bed and the desk and the chair and the lamp and the Smith Corona, my Smith Corona even. And to put them all in the front yard, next to the rock garden, not too close to the maple tree. My clothes, my books, my bookcases, my report cards, my ferrofosite posters, my shoes, three years worth of interview magazines, the good ones with the Andy Warhol covers, you know, everything. And then with my brother and my sister and my grandparents watching, my mother removed a cigarette from this tiny crocheted case she always kept them in. And she lit the cigarette and then she took the match and put it to the pile of things there in the front yard that contained the soul and complete record of my existence and my family. It had burned for seven and a half hours, thanks in part to the addition of some lighter fluid to help get the larger pieces of furniture going. All of it, all that was me prior to that memorable memorial day up in flames. According to my sister, who years later recounted these details to me, it was a mighty, impressive blaze. In their eagerness to feed it and due to an unexpected wind off the fields around the house, the sugar maple that was older than my great grandfather caught a spark in its branches and was sacrificed. They cut off all communication with me. They emptied and closed our joint bank account. There goes college. They barred the door. They stopped talking, stopped answering my letters, stopped taking my calls. They stopped anything with me. They just stopped. I was completely disbelieving. I mean, this didn't make any sense. All of my friends had stories about telling their families. They were gay and they all ended the same way. Sooner or later, everything worked out fine. So I even had a friend named Neil, whose parents had done the same thing. At first, they just stopped talking to him. But one year later, they were inviting his new boyfriend to come home with him for the holidays. Everyone counseled me to have a little patience and have a little hope. And this is how it starts, slowly, just a little hope, just enough to get you through. But hope is cumulative. A little bit here and a little bit there, it builds up in the system until it becomes something toxic, denial. I mean, their reaction had been, yes, extreme, but not the worst that could happen. The thing to do was to be a good son, to make them proud, to earn back their love. So I got a job. And then another, and then a third. Three shifts, three restaurants, six days a week. That would show them. But they weren't watching. I wrote them letters, lots of letters about nothing. It's Tuesday and it's hot. Or my new roommate is named Kathy. Or my friends took me out from my birthday yesterday. They didn't write back. Living for me sort of came to a halt, despite the fact that my life just went on and on. I didn't think about my future. I didn't think about my needs. I didn't think about my sadness. I didn't think about any of it. I didn't have to, because I had hope. Every day, whispering in my ear, don't give up. Don't walk away. You're almost there. Don't stop. Don't grow. Don't develop. Don't worry. Just don't make any sudden movements or you'll blow it. So six years went on like this without a word from them. So finally, hurt and confused beyond my ability to hold it in. And frankly, finding it really difficult to maintain the illusion that this was temporary. I decided to kind of make one more attempt to force the issue. So I flew home and showed up unannounced at my mother's office. It was an amazing visit. I asked the receptionist to page my mother and tell her she had a surprise visitor. And I stood there in the lobby. And I remember seeing my mother come down this long hallway toward me. And she was walking, and then she sort of looked up. And she saw me. And then she recognized who it was. And she turned and walked away again. It was a really amazing 90-second visit. Two and a half weeks later, a black funeral wreath was delivered to me at my office with a note that said, in memory of our son. Clearly, it was time to give up hope and take up therapy. So I talked to a counselor who asked me why I had invited this turmoil into my life. I talked to a minister who suggested a Christian youth camp. I talked to a lesbian who offered to slash my mother's tires if I'd paid for her flight there. I signed up for screen therapy where I beat pillows with tennis rackets and screamed obscenities and pulled a muscle in my shoulder. Mostly, I talked to friends and mostly the pain persisted. The sheer weight of it nearly crushed me. Or at least that's how it felt at the time. Since it was my constant companion, I spent most of my time turning it over in my mind, fingering it like some sort of psychological worry stone. Over the years, it's been eroded by so much handling. All the remains now is a small, hard, nearly weightless pebble, really. Worn away is most of the anger and much of the hurt. But one question remains, how was it possible that they taught me love and loyalty in excess of that which they themselves possessed? I have come to believe that it's not possible to understand what they did, not possible for me anyway. To understand it would seem to indicate that there was some justification for it. And I know for certain that there is not. Still, there's no escaping my parents. This thing they did, this extreme and unfathomable and many layered thing they did tore a hole in the middle of my life. I have spent years and a lot of money darning that hole while trying to keep the rest of my world from unraveling. And yet their influence on me is enduring. My parents loved me terribly. I have been courageous in the face of bullies. There is such a thing as too much patience, but no such thing is too much forgiveness. And love has seen me through every misfortune. Thank you."
100,canplanetearthfeedtenbillionpeoplepart2.wav," The story of nitrogen. Almost everybody eats every day, but too few of us give any thought to how that happens. If agricultural history were required in schools, more people would know the name of Justus Fun Leebig, who in the mid-19th century established that the amount of nitrogen in the soil controls the rate of plant growth. Thousands of science have charged Leebig with faking his data and stealing others' ideas, accurately so far as I can tell. But he was also a visionary who profoundly changed the human species' relationship with nature. Smarmy, but far-sighted, Leebig imagined a new kind of agriculture, farming as a branch of chemistry and physics. Soil was just a base with the physical attributes necessary to hold roots. For in-itrogen-containing compounds, factory-made fertilizer, and gigantic harvests would automatically follow. In today's terms, Leebig was taking the first steps toward chemically regulated industrial agriculture, an early version of wizardly thought. But there was no obvious way to manufacture the nitrogenous substances that feed plants. That technology was provided before and during the First World War by two German chemists Fritz Haber and Karl Bosch. Their subsequent Nobel prizes were richly deserved. The Haber Bosch process, as it is called, was arguably the most consequential technological innovation of the 20th century. Today the Haber Bosch process is responsible for almost all of the world's synthetic fertilizer. A little more than 1% of the world's industrial energy is devoted to it. That 1%, the futurist Ramesh Nam has noted, roughly doubles the amount of food the world can grow. The environmental scientist Watslav Smil has estimated that nitrogen fertilizer from the Haber Bosch process accounts for the prevailing diets of nearly 45% of the world's population. More than three billion men, women and children, an incomprehensibly vast cloud of hopes, fears, memories and dreams owe their existence to two obscure German chemists. Hard on the heels of the gains came the losses. About 40% of the fertilizer applied in the past 60 years was not absorbed by plants. Instead, it washed away into rivers or seeped into the air in the form of nitrous oxides. Water flushed into water still fertilizes. It boosts the growth of algae, weeds and other aquatic organisms. When these die, they fall to the floor of the river, lake or ocean, where microbes consume their remains. So rapidly do the microbes grow on the manner of dead algae and weeds that their respiration drains oxygen from the lower depths, killing off most other life. Even from midwestern farms flows down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico every summer, creating an oxygen desert that in 2016 covered almost 7,000 square miles. The next year a still larger dead zone, 23,000 square miles, was mapped in the Bay of Bengal off the east coast of India. Rising into the air, nitrous oxides from fertilizers is a major cause of pollution. High in the stratosphere, it combines with and neutralizes the planet's ozone, which guards life on the surface by blocking cancer-causing ultraviolet rays. Were it not for climate change suggests the science writer Oliver Morton, the spread of nitrogen's empire would probably be our biggest ecological worry. Passionate resistance to that empire sprang up even before Haber and Bosch became Nobel laureates. This leader was an English farm boy named Albert Howard, 1873 to 1947, who spent most of his career as British India's official imperial economic botanist. Individually and together, Howard and his wife Gabrielle, a Cambridge educated plant physiologist, spent their time in India breeding new varieties of wheat and tobacco, developing novel types of plows, and testing the results of providing oxen with a super-healthy diet. By the end of the First World War, they were convinced that soil was not simply a base for chemical additives. It was an intricate living system that required a wildly complex mix of nutrients in plant and animal waste, harvest leftovers, manure. The Howard summed up their ideas in what they called the Law of Return. The faithful returned to the soil of all available vegetable, animal, and human wastes. We depend on plants, plants depend on soil, and soil depends on us. Howard's 1943 Agricultural Testament became the founding document of the organic movement. Wizards attacked Howard and Jerome E. Rodale, a hard-scrabble New York-born entrepreneur, publisher, playwright, gardening theorist, and food experimenter who publicized Howard's ideas through books and magazines, as charlatans and crackpots. It is true that their zeal was inspired by a near-religious faith in a limit-bound natural order, but when Howard lauded the living nature of the soil, he was referring to the community of soil organisms, the dynamic relations between plant roots and the earth around them, the physical structure of humus, which stickly binds together soil particles into airy crumbs that hold water instead of letting it run through. All of this was very real, and all of it was unknown when Leibig shaped the basic ideas behind chemical agriculture. The claim Howard made in his many books and speeches that industrial farming was depopulating the countryside and disrupting an older way of life was accurate, too, though his opponents disagreed with him about whether this was a bad thing. Nowadays the prophet's fears about industrial agriculture's exhausting the soil seem pressioned, a landmark 2011 study from the United Nations' food and agriculture organization concluded that up to a third of the world's crop land is degraded. At first reconciling the two points of view might have been possible. One can imagine Borlogi and Wizards considering manure and other natural soil inputs, and voteian prophets willing to use chemicals as a supplement to good soil practice. But that didn't happen. Hurling insults, the two sides moved further apart. They set in motion a battle that has continued into the 21st century, and become ever more intense with the ubiquity of genetically modified crops. That battle is not just between two philosophies, two approaches to technology, two ways of thinking how best to increase the food supply for a growing population. It is about whether the tools we choose will ensure the survival of the planet or hasten its destruction. Not one of evolution's finest efforts. All the while that Wizards were championing synthetic fertilizer and prophets were denouncing it, they were united in ignorance. Nobody knew why plants were so dependent on nitrogen. Only after the Second World War did scientists discover that plants need nitrogen chiefly to make a protein called rubisco, a prima donna in the dance of interactions that is photosynthesis. In photosynthesis, as children learn in school, plants use energy from the sun to tear apart carbon dioxide and water, lending their constituents into the compounds necessary to make roots, stems, leaves, and seeds. Rubisco is an enzyme that plays a key role in the process. Enzymes are biological catalysts, like J. walking pedestrians who cause automobile accidents, but escape untouched enzymes cause biochemical reactions to occur, but are unchanged by those reactions. Rubisco takes carbon dioxide from the air, inserts it into the maelstrom of photosynthesis, then goes back for more. Because these movements are central to the process, photosynthesis walks at the speed of rubisco. Alas, rubisco is, by biological standards, a sluggard, a lazy bones, a couch potato. Whereas typical enzyme molecules catalyze thousands of reactions a second, rubisco molecules dain to involve themselves with just two or three a second. Worse, rubisco is inept. As many as two out of every five times, rubisco fumblingly picks up oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, causing the chain of reactions in photosynthesis to break down and have to restart, wasting energy and water. Years ago I talked with biologists about photosynthesis for a magazine article. Not one had a good word to say about rubisco. Nearly the world's worst most incompetent enzyme said one researcher, not one of evolution's finest efforts said another. To overcome rubisco's lassitude and malladroitness, plants make a lot of it, requiring a lot of nitrogen to do so. As much as half of the protein in many plant leaves by weight is rubisco. It is often said to be the world's most abundant protein. One estimate is that plants and microorganisms contain more than eleven pounds of rubisco for every person on earth. One would think should have improved rubisco. No such luck. But it did produce a workaround. See for photosynthesis. See for refers to a four carbon molecule involved in the scheme. At once a biochemical clooge and a clever mechanism for turbocharging plant growth, see for photosynthesis consists of a wholesale reorganization of leaf anatomy. When carbon dioxide comes into a C4 leaf, it is initially grabbed not by rubisco, but by a different enzyme that uses it to form a compound that is then pumped into special rubisco filled cells deep in the leaf. These cells have almost no oxygen, so rubisco can't bumblingly grab the wrong molecule. The end result is exactly the same sugars, starches, and cellulose that ordinary photosynthesis produces, except much faster. See for plants need less water and fertilizer than ordinary plants because they don't waste water on rubisco's mistakes. In the sort of convergence that makes biologists snap to attention, see for photosynthesis has arisen independently more than 60 times. Corn, tumbleweed, crabgrass, sugarcane, and bermuda grass. All of these very different plants evolved C4 photosynthesis. In the botanical equivalent of a moon shot, scientists from around the world are trying to convert rice into a C4 plant, one that would grow faster, require less water and fertilizer, and produce more grain. The scope and audacity of the project are hard to overstate. Rice is the world's most important food stuff, the staple crop for more than half the global population. A food so embedded in Asian culture that the words rice and meal are variants of each other in both Chinese and Japanese. Nobody can predict with confidence how much more rice farmers will need to grow by 2050, but estimates range up to a 40% rise, driven by both increasing population numbers and increasing affluence, which permits formerly poor people to switch to rice from less prestigious staples such as millet and sweet potato. Meanwhile the land available to plant rice is shrinking as cities expand into the countryside, thirsty people drain rivers, farmers switch to more profitable crops, and climate change creates deserts from farmland. Running short of rice would be a human catastrophe with consequences that would ripple around the world. The C4 Rice Consortium is an attempt to ensure that that never happens. Funded largely by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the consortium is the world's most ambitious genetic engineering project. But the term genetic engineering does not capture the project scope. The genetic engineering that appears in news reports typically involves big companies sticking individual packets of genetic material, usually from a foreign species, into a crop. The paradigmatic example is Monsanto's Roundup Ready Soybean, which contains a snippet of DNA from a bacterium that was found in a Louisiana waste pond. That snippet makes the plant assemble a chemical compound in its leaves and stems that blocks the effects of Roundup, Monsanto's widely used herbicide. The foreign gene lets farmers spray Roundup on their soy fields, killing weeds but leaving the crop unharmed. Except for making a single, tasteless, odorless, non-toxic protein, Roundup Ready Soybeans are otherwise identical to ordinary soybeans. What the C4 Rice Consortium is trying to do with rice bears the same resemblance to typically genetically modified crops as a Boeing 787 does to a paper airplane. Rather than tinker with individual genes in order to monetize seeds, the scientists are trying to refashion photosynthesis, one of the most fundamental processes of life. Because C4 has evolved in so many different species, scientists believe that most plants must have precursor C4 genes. The hope is that rice is one of these, and that the consortium can identify and awaken its dormant C4 genes, following a path evolution has taken many times before. Ideally researchers would switch on sleeping chunks of genetic material already in rice, or use very similar genes from related species that are close cousins but easier to work with, to create, in effect, a new and more productive species. Common rice, oriza sativa, will become something else, oriza nova, say. No company will profit from the result. The International Rice Research Institute, where much of the research takes place, will give away seeds for the modified grain, as it did with green revolution rice. When I visited eerie, 35 miles southeast of downtown Manila, scores of people were doing what science does best, breaking the problem into individual pieces, then attacking the pieces. Some were sprouting rice in petri dishes. Others were trying to find chance variations in existing rice strains that might be helpful. Still others were studying a model organism, a C4 species of grass called sataria viridis. Fast growing and able to be grown in soil, not patties, sataria is easier to work with in the lab than rice. There were experiments to measure differences in photosynthetic chemicals, in the rates of growth of different varieties, in the transmission of biochemical markers. Half a dozen people in white coats were sorting seeds on a big table, grain by grain. More were in fields outside, tending experimental rice patties. All of the appertances of contemporary biology were in evidence. Flat screen monitors, humming refrigerators and freezers, tables full of beakers of recombinant goo, dillbert and XKCD cartoons taped to whiteboards, a united nations of graduate students, a gossip in the cafeteria, air conditioners whooshing in a row outside the windows. Directing the C4 rice consortium is Jane Langdale, a molecular geneticist at Oxford's Department of Plant Sciences. Initial research, she told me, suggests that about a dozen genes play a major part in leaf structure, and perhaps another ten genes have an equivalent role in the biochemistry. All must be activated in a way that does not affect the plant's existing desirable qualities and that allows the genes to coordinate their actions. The next equally arduous step would be breeding rice varieties that can channel the extra growth provided by C4 photosynthesis into additional grains rather than roots or stalk. All the while varieties must be disease-resistant, easy to grow, and palatable for their intended audience in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. I think it can all happen, but it might not, Langdale said. She was quick to point out that even if C4 rice runs into insurmountable obstacles, it is not the only biological moonshot. A fertilizing maze, wheat that can grow in saltwater, enhanced soil microbial ecosystems, all are being researched. The odds that any one of these projects will succeed may be small, the idea goes, but the odds that all of them will fail are equally small. The wizardly process begun by Borlough is, in Langdale's view, still going strong."
101,avatar.wav," Tom Wates loved the novel, J.T. LaRoy, had written, called Sarah. He wanted to do an interview with J.T. LaRoy for Vanity Fair magazine. He wanted J.T.'s input on who would photograph the spread. Because J.T. LaRoy was notoriously shy. One of the reasons why J.T. was so shy was because J.T. didn't have a body. J.T. was an avatar. So let me take you back some years. I was 16, 17 years old and I was awarded the State in a group home in New York City. Eight girls, one bathroom. And the girls had all had stories being, some had been raped, stabbed by a parent, sold and dislavery. Everyone had secrets at nighttime. We'd tell our secrets and you couldn't tell. And I was the one they would come to and tell their stories. And if you asked me why I was there, I don't know, all the intakes, dysfunctional family, I dropped out of school, I don't know. But I was always interested in how do you tell? There was this movie, Streetwise, it was a documentary by Maryl and Mark about homeless kids in Seattle. And I gathered up some of my friends, my best friend Lauren from the group home. We'd been institutionalized together prior to the group home and we went and saw this movie. And we saw ourselves on the screen. Now the street can seduce you and these kids were getting swallowed. And we knew we were just one step removed. And when we left the movie. I saw how people looked at us, right before they were kind of scared of us. And I got off on that, you know, because we'd street all over us. But after the movie they looked at us with this kind of curious compassion. And suddenly I didn't want to be the victim in the movie. I was interested in how do you make that bridge so people suddenly care. And curious enough to maybe care. How do you do that? And in the group home, everyone's telling their stories. And I don't even know how to tell mine. I don't even have the tools to tell mine. And I would go to buy a little relief to a street corner. There's a foam booth right on the corner and I would remove it from me. I'd be a boy. And I'd call hotlines and I'd tell them all the stories, my story, my pain, everyone's stories. The house parent who survived the B.O.F.R.N. wars, I'm saying to me, Laura, your job is to tell our stories. Because the group home, my job was I was a translator. So some girls having some problems with the house parent. They'd come to me and I would translate between what each other was saying. Again, if you asked me, I don't know. All I knew is if you heard what my story was, my deepest belief was that you would say, well, you deserve it. You're disgusting, you're horrible. My deepest hope was that you wouldn't. But I never ever gave you the chance. But I wanted to learn the tools to tell. Because that's the bridge. And I won a scholarship to the new school for social research. And they let me in without the SATs. I said, I can't take the SATs. My last grade of completion is six. And they let me in with an essay. I'm taking every writing class. I can get my hands on it. And I wrote this piece in this class about you can tell a kid that's not going to survive along on the street because the scars run this way. And the kids are there wrapped in wrapped. And everyone's looking to see who's exterior matches the story. And everyone's looking at this one cool guy. He's all raggedy. And I'm in the group home. And I'm just looking. I'm looking at him too. And I want it to be him because he matches the voice. And I don't want them to know it's me because it's going to ruin it. I want it to be him. And then when they leave, because they don't know, it was anonymous reading the story. And then when we leave, I hear people talking about, wow, I never thought of it that way. I didn't know that about the scene and that. And I'm like, that's what I want. How do you get people to see what they never? They never saw before. They never knew before. I keep writing, but never as myself. The writing gives me a little more relief. I start writing under the name Jeremy, which becomes JT. For me, I buy myself another day every time I can find a way to tell, but as long as it's not coming for me, never as a woman. So when I get asked by Tom Waits, when he asked JT LaRoy who he wants to photograph, Mary Ellen Mark. My sister-in-law came over one day and she just shaved her head. And I'm looking at her and she looks like the blonde hair, blue-eyed little boys that I would see in the after school specials when they were just starting to talk about abuse, sexual abuse. Always a blonde hair, blue-eyed, cute little boy that you would forgive and love, no matter what they did, no matter how transgressive and bad they were. You just love them. I never saw myself represented in any of that. So she looked, she was JT. And she agreed to be my avatar. Now, Mary Ellen Mark said that the person she was photographing did not feel like somebody who had suffered, like someone. It felt like someone who maybe came from privilege, but she said the books needed to be in the world, the book showed a world she had never seen that she wanted the books to be out there and she photographed the avatar. I continued to publish under the name JT LaRoy. I wrote the book Sarah, which was received with great acclaim. I published it as fiction, all my work as fiction. I came to pass that this book that explored the wilds of West Virginia, a state I had never been in, in this kind of magical I play with gender and identity and it's the spirit. Everything that I had experienced, all the pain, all the suffering, the joy, the hope, the holding onto finding that a possibility of being saved no matter what, the spirit, the humor, it was all in there turned upside down in this book, Sarah. Came to pass that I am revealed as JT LaRoy. The articulation in the New York Times is hoax, perpetrator, culprit, the jig is up, come clean, liar, fake fiction writer, no sh** New York Times, fake fiction writer. Oscar Wilde said, give a man a mask and he'll tell you the truth. I received death threats, hate mail, was blacklisted, sued in a federal f**king court. People didn't understand why I wouldn't apologize, she won't apologize. How could you apologize for what kept me alive? I couldn't do it another way. We knew no other way. Slowly the fan mail came back, I would get letters where people would talk about what the work meant to it, how it transformed them, how it saved their lives, how it allowed them to see a world that they had never seen before. I got invited to speak, welcome back into the community of artists, to speak all over the world in spring. I did a sold out reading at Foils and London and I'm signing books as in me and these collectors are there and I'm signing books where editions and languages that I didn't even know existed. I'm leaving my body and all of a sudden the crowd's kind of part and this girl comes walking towards me, she's big and she's got cuts all over her arms, she's carrying a bag and I know what's coming, it's what I've been preparing for my whole life. She reaches on her bag and I know she's going to stab me and she takes out a book and she tells me that she came to my work after the reveal. She asks me to sign her diary. I realize that everything that had happened up to that moment had prepared me for this and I got up and I held her."
102,lawsthatchokecreativity.wav," I'm going to tell you three stories on the way to one argument that's going to tell you a little bit about how we open user generated content up for business. So here's the first story. 1906, this man, John Philip Sousa, traveled to this place, the United States, capital to talk about this technology, what he called the, quote, talking machines. Sousa was not a fan of the talking machines. This is what he had to say. These talking machines are going to ruin artistic development of music in this country. When I was a boy in front of every house in the summer evenings, you would find young people together singing the songs of the day or the old songs. Today you hear these infernal machines going night and day. We will not have a vocal cord left, Sousa said. The vocal cords will be eliminated by a process of evolution as was the tale of man when he came from the ape. This is a picture of culture. We could describe it using modern computer terminology as a kind of read, write culture. It's a culture where people participate in the creation and the re-creation of their culture in that sense, it's read, write. Sousa's fear was that we would lose that capacity because of these, quote, infernal machines. They would take it away. And in its place, we'd have the opposite of read, write culture, what we could call read only culture. Culture where creativity was consumed, but the consumer is not a creator. A culture which is top down, owned, where the vocal cords of the millions have been lost. Now as you look back at the 20th century, at least in what we think of as the, quote, developed world, hard not to conclude that Sousa was right. Never before in the history of human culture had it been as professionalized, never before, as concentrated, never before, as creativity of the millions been as effectively displaced and displaced because of these, quote, infernal machines. The 20th century was that century where at least for those places we know best, culture moved from this read, write to read only existence. So second, land is a kind of property, is property, it's protected by law. As Lord Blackstone described it, land is protected by trust pass law. For most of the history of trust pass law, by presuming it protects the land all the way down below and to an indefinite extent, upwards. That was a pretty good system for most of the history of the regulation of land until this technology came along. And people began to wonder, were these instruments trust passers as they flew over land without clearing the rights of the farms below as they traveled across the country? Well, in 1945, Supreme Court got a chance to address that question. Two farmers, Thomas Lee and Teenie Cosby, who raised chickens, had a significant complaint because of these technologies. The complaint was that their chickens followed the pattern of the airplanes and flew themselves into the walls of barn when the airplanes flew over the land. And so they appealed to Lord Blackstone to say, these airplanes were trust passing. Since time immemorial, the law had said, you can't fly over the land without permission of the land owner. So this flight must stop. Well, the Supreme Court considered this hundred years tradition and said, in an opinion written by Justice Douglas, that the Cosby's must lose. The Supreme Court said, the doctrine protecting land all the ways to the sky has no place in the modern world. Otherwise, every transcontinental flight would be subject the operator to countless trust pass suits. Common sense, a rare idea in the law, but here it was, common sense, revolts at the idea, common sense. Finally, before the internet, the last great terror to rain down on the content industry was a terror created by this technology, broadcasting, a new way to spread content, and therefore a new battle over the control of the businesses that would spread content. Now at that time, the entity, the legal cartel that controlled the performance rights for most of the music that would be broadcast using these technologies was ASCAP. They had an exclusive license on the most popular content, and they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrate to the broadcasters who really was in charge. So between 1931 and 1939, they raised rates by some 448%. Until the broadcasters finally got together and said, okay, enough of this. And in 1939, a lawyer, Siddi Kay, started something called Broadcast Music Incorporated. You know, it is BMI. And BMI was much more democratic in the art that it would include within its repertoire, including American music for the first time in the repertoire. But most important was that BMI took public domain works and made arrangements of them, which they gave away for free to their subscribers. So that in 1940, when ASCAP threatened to double their rates, the majority of broadcasters switched to BMI. Now ASCAP said they didn't care. The people will revolt, they predicted, because the very best music was no longer available, because they had shifted to the second best public domain provided by BMI. Well, they didn't revolt. And in 1941, ASCAP cracked. And the important point to recognize is that even though these broadcasters were broadcasting something you'd call second best, that competition was enough to break at that time this legal cartel over access to music. Okay, three stories, here's the argument. In my view, the most significant thing to recognize about what this internet is doing is its opportunity to revive the read-write culture that Sousa romanticized. Global technologies is the opportunity for the revival of these vocal cords that he spoke so passionately to Congress about. User generated content spreading in businesses in extraordinarily valuable ways, celebrating amateur culture by which I don't mean amateurish culture. I mean culture where people produce for the love of what they're doing and not for the money. I mean the culture that your kids are producing all the time. For when you think of what Sousa romanticized in the young people together singing the songs of the day of the old songs, you should recognize what your kids are doing right now. Taking the songs of the day and the old songs and remixing them to make them something different, it's how they understand access to this culture. I'm not talking about nor justifying people taking other people's content in wholesale and distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner. I'm talking about people taking and recreating using other people's content, using digital technologies to say things differently. It is now anybody with access to a $1,500 computer who can take sounds and images from the culture around us and use it to say things differently. These tools of creativity have become tools of speech. It is a literacy for this generation. This is how our kids speak. It is how our kids think. It is what your kids are as they increasingly understand digital technologies and their relationship to themselves. So in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies, the law has not greeted this Sousa revival with very much common sense. Instead the architecture of copyright law and the architecture of digital technologies as they interact have produced the presumption that these activities are illegal because of copyright law at its core regulates something called copies. And in the digital world, the one fact we can't escape is that every single use of culture produces a copy. Every single use therefore requires permission without permission you are a trust passer. Common sense here though has not yet revolted in response to this response the law has offered to these forms of creativity. Instead what we've seen is something much worse than a revolt. There's a growing extremism that comes from both sides in this debate in response to this conflict between the law and the use of these technologies. One side builds new technologies such as one recently announced that will enable them to automatically take down from sites like YouTube any content that has any copyrighted content in it whether or not there's a judgment of fair use that might be applied to the use of that content. And on the other side among our kids there's a growing copyright abolitionism, a generation that rejects the very notion of what copyright is supposed to do, rejects copyright and believes that the law is nothing more than an ass to be ignored and to be fought at every opportunity possible. The extremism on one side gets extremism on the other. A fact we should have learned many many times over and both extremes in this debate are just wrong. Now the balance that I try to fight for, I as any good liberal tried to fight for first by looking to the government, total mistake. Look first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them to do something to make the system make more sense. It failed partly because the courts are too passive partly because the legislatures are corrupted by which I don't mean that there's bribery operating to stop real change but more the economy of influence that governs how Congress functions means that policy makers here will not understand this until it's too late to fix it. So we need something different. We need a different kind of solution. And the solution here in my view is a private solution. A solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again and to realize the economic potential of that and that's where the story of BMI becomes relevant. Because as BMI demonstrated, competition here can achieve some form of balance. The same thing can happen now. We don't have a public domain to draw upon now so instead what we need is two types of changes. First, that artist and creators embrace the idea, choose, that their work be made available more freely. So for example, they can say their work is available freely for non-commercial, this amateur type of use but not freely for any commercial use. And second, we need the businesses that are building out this read right culture to embrace this opportunity expressly to enable it so that this ecology of free content or free art content can grow on a neutral platform where they both exist simultaneously so that more free can compete with less free and the opportunity to develop the creativity in that competition can teach one the lessons of the other. Now I would talk about one particular such plan that I know something about but I don't want to violate Ted's first commandment of selling so I'm not going to talk about this at all. I'm just going to remind you of the point that BMI teaches us that artist choice is the key for new technology having an opportunity to be open for business and we need to build artist choice here if these new technologies are to have that opportunity. But let me end with something I think much more important, much more important in business. It's the point about how this connects to our kids. We have to recognize they are different from us. It is technology that has made them different. And as we see what this technology can do, we need to recognize you can't kill the instinct the technology produces, we can only criminalize it. We can't stop our kids from using it, we can only drive it underground, we can't make our kids passive again, we can only make them quote pirates and is that good? We live in this weird time, it's kind of age of prohibitions where in many areas of our life we live life constantly against the law, ordinary people live life against the law and that's what we are doing to our kids. They live life knowing they live it against the law. That realization is extraordinarily corrupting and in a democracy we ought to be able to do better, to better at least for them if not for opening for business."
103,alternateithicatom.wav," There are some scientists who say that the universe that we inhabit is not the only universe there is. There are alternate universes. They say that these universes arise from the subatomic realm of quantum physics. Here's how they say it works. Every time a quantum event happens, it produces all of its possible results. This is like saying if you flip a coin, it comes up heads, but it also comes up tails. Since those two results are mutually exclusive, the flipping of the coin splits the universe into two alternate universes. The heads universe and the tails universe. And since quantum events are happening all the time, it means that alternate universes are bubbling up continually. They're always being created, splitting off from ours. And these alternate universes are real. They're not just figments of the imagination. They're complete whole real things. I know this is true because I experienced an alternate universe. I was driving in my Volkswagen van up to a tight sheet camp in upstate New York a couple of summers ago. I bought the Volkswagen van when I quit my job a few years previously. I bought the van because I quit the job as a custom database application engineer. This was not a job that I really had intended to become. When I was a kid, that's not what I thought I was going to be. It's just sort of the job I happened into. And I always thought of it as the work I was doing before I was going to find my real work. But when I got close to about 40, I suddenly thought, oh my god, this could be it. This could be what I end up doing. This could be on my tombstone, Tom Weiser, custom database application engineer, well optimized queries. Many customers satisfied. And I thought, no, that can't be it. That can't be all there is. And I quit the job without really knowing what I was going to do next. And I knew that what I should do was to take my skill set and to make a lateral move to a career path that was more appropriate. But I really didn't want to do that. I didn't want to be so logical. I actually wanted something more magic. I wanted to be like the guy in the fairy tale that trades the cow for the magic beans. And I know that that's a bad deal. I know that the cow is a better investment. The cow is going to pay off in the long term. But if the magic beans work out, you're in a whole new story. So I quit the job and I bought a Volkswagen pop top camper van. And I drove around country and what I thought is, okay, I'm not going to make a lateral move. I am going to drive around the country and I'm going to open myself up to whatever may come. And then what I'm going to do is going to arise organically. I'm going to find my next path there by the side of the road in Arizona. I'm going to pick it up and bring it back to New York. So I drove around the country 25,000 miles, eight months. And when I got back to New York, I had no clue. I really didn't know and it left me very vulnerable to the New York question. The first question anybody asked, which is, so what do you do? I didn't know. I didn't have a good answer and it made me feel really embarrassed because everybody knows what they do. Everybody doesn't. I thought I should too. So when I was driving the Volkswagen van up to Tai Chi Camp the other summer, I felt very relieved because in camp, I know what I do. I do the camp thing. I do what's at camp and I don't know if you know this, but there are a lot of camps for adults that are out there. I found them when I was driving around the country. There are Tai Chi camps and yoga camps and bird watching camps. There's even a camp where you can dress up in armor and joust. All the things that give us joy and that we tend to demean with the name hobby. Those are the things that are celebrated in camp. And when people go to camp, they are so lit up. They are finally getting to do that thing. The thing they love is like, yes, I finally get to joust. I don't have time for that anymore. Really? So I was going up to camp and feeling pretty good about it. And I decided on the way I would stop into Ithaca. I'd heard that it was kind of a neat town. So I pulled off the highway into Ithaca and it's on the southern shore of Lake Kayuga. There's flat land in these hills and it has a very particular microclimate there, which allows hippies to survive. So all the stores have names like it takes a village or hemp unlimited. And the children are all completely multi-ethnic and only wear cloth organic diapers. It was really something. I drove around like sort of like Disney hippyland just watching it. And then I drove up the hill, up to Cornell, which has these stately buildings on the hilltop. And as I drove onto the campus, I had this stabbing sensation and I suddenly was pierced with a vision of an alternate universe. My alternate life. I thought, oh my God, I was supposed to go to Cornell. If I had gone to Cornell, I would have studied animal behavior. And right now, I'd be a professor of evolutionary biology. I'm a professor of evolutionary biology and I've got a wife. She's got dark hair. She's really smart. And I'm a professor with a wife and we've got two kids. They like to sing. It was this completely realized vision of this alternate life and it looked so good. Alternate Ithaca, Tom, he'd made these great choices. It was really working out. And I drove around in a kind of a wash of nostalgia for this life that I hadn't had. It's like, wow, there's the Human Ecology Center. I did all my grad work there. And there was this funky cottage that I used to live in. I had six roommates and we had a chore wheel and eight ground rice. And there was these gorges that we used to do drum circles in and songs to the goddess. And there was this woman that looked just like my wife would have looked when I would have met her. I was overwhelmed by it. I couldn't stand to stay there any longer. I drove off the campus. I fled Ithaca and flew to Tai Chi camp. But alternate Ithaca, Tom came with me. Now at camps, I tend to really have a good time. I laugh a lot, I joke a lot, especially in Tai Chi camp. With the residents are kind of serious and slow moving. I can't help but kind of tease them. And in this particular camp, the teacher said that we were going to be meditating every morning from seven to eight. And she was looking for a volunteer, someone, a musician, that would wander the hallways playing an instrument or singing to wake up the residents. I'm not a morning person. And so I thought, oh, so I have a choice here. Either it's going to be six thirty, I'll be lying in my bed really grumpy. Well, some asshole sings outside my door. Or I could be the singing asshole. For the rest of that week, I was the singing asshole of the camp. Every morning I would roam the hall singing lustily, waking up all my fellow Tai Chi players. And the people there saw me laughing and singing. And they said, Tom, it's really great to have you here. You're so happy. You're such a happy guy. And I thought, yeah, you think I'm happy. But you haven't seen alternate Ithaca Tom. I've seen him. He's happy. And the fact that he was so much happier than me was making me miserable. And I kept looking at everybody else's life and comparing myself to them. And I remember having lunch with a woman who were in her sixties and she was a calligrapher. And she was about to have her first grandchild. She was really excited. And I thought, maybe calligraphy. That could be it. And then there was this other guy. And he had studied Tai Chi when he was in his twenties. And now he was a sales rep at Dell. And I thought, damn it, if I had studied Tai Chi in my twenties, maybe I could be a sales rep at Dell now. I've never wanted to be a sales rep. But I was just getting carried away. That feeling that I was in the wrong life. It was in the wrong place. I couldn't shake it. I really tried to absorb the lesson of Tai Chi, which is to be present, just relax, accept what's coming to you and be present here. But I thought, yeah, yeah, that would be easy. It's so much easier to accept where you are. If only you're in the right place. Well, eventually camp was over and I left. I drove back to New York. And as I was driving over the George Washington bridge, I could still hear alternate Ithaca Tom. He was hanging around me, haunting me like a ghost. And I thought, oh, God, I need professional help. So I made an appointment with the family psychic. This is the guy that's done readings for all of my siblings and my cousins. And I went to see him. And he's an astrologer. So he did out my chart. And this time, he was very interested in this polarity that he saw. He said, you have Saturn in the mid-heaven. And this marks you as a person who could be very organizational. The organizational man, the hierarchical one, the corporate guy, the dad, the provider. Not particularly sexy, but a straight-up guy. On the other hand, there's Pisces in the sun. And they're squared with each other. You can't resolve them. Pisces in the dreamer, the mystic, the guy that's the artist, never quite pinned down, never quite in a relationship. And you have to balance these two. You have to choose one or the other. And normally, I love to hear this kind of thing. This is the great thing about going to a psychic is that for an hour, they just talk about me. It's so interesting. But this time, I was so caught up with alternate ethic at the time. I couldn't really appreciate it all. So I just blurted out what had happened to me. And I asked him, what does this mean? And the psychic said, wow, this represents a fundamental choice that you've made in your life. You could have been the hierarchical guy. But you chose to be the Pisian. If you had decided to be an academic, you would have been very successful. There's no doubt that the university structure would have raised you up. You probably would be married, have kids. And I thought, oh, shit, alternate ethic at the time made the right choices. But the psychic said, if you had become an academic, your wife would have had an affair with your brother or your best friend. Alternate ethic at the time is crushed. He's just found out that his wife is having an affair with his research partner. This is the guy he's been working with for 15 years. It's a long-term affair. They're moving in together. She's taking the kids. He's completely crushed. Poor alternate. Ethic atom. He starts drinking. He can't keep his lecture notes together. He can't keep his research together. He's coming up for tenure. And it's all falling apart. And in the midst of his turmoil, he suddenly pierced by this vision of himself driving a Volkswagen van. He's off to camp. It's a Tai Chi camp. He's not married. He doesn't have kids. He doesn't even have a job. He's completely free. It looks so good. This image pierces him to his heart. Begins to hang around him and haunt him like a hungry ghost."
104,listo.wav," I was 28 years old and I was just about to graduate from the Culinary Institute of America. And I was on a crazy high, man. I just had worked at two of the best restaurants in New York, at La Bernadette and Oriol at the time. And I was doing really well at Culinary School. I had never done well in school before. I was graduating towards the top of my class. I was cocky at shit. I was full of just complete confidence and even just ordering people around out of nowhere, just like strangers telling you what to do. And I got recruited for this job out in California. And I had these dreams of just going back to Cali. So I took the job. I wasn't ready for this job. It was a job to run a resort and be the chef. But when I got off for the job, I just thought and I dreamed because out of my cockiness, all I thought and dreamed about was the white chef coat and putting my name on my left chest and writing executive chef underneath and wearing the long Chris Paprin. So I took the job. And it was in Barrego Springs, California. And it's a resort called La Casa Del Zoro. It was a beautiful resort. Cabanas, five star, everything. And I was there running the kitchen. And it's funny in my life. I have this weird thing in my life where I end up always becoming friends with people that maybe I don't speak the same language of or I didn't grow up in the same way. And especially in the kitchen with a lot of Latino cooks and dishwashers and waiters and busters. And there was this man Salvador. He was our dishwasher at the time. And he had this body almost like Jack Black. And just red, beautiful face. And always a grin on his face. I mean, no matter how hard his job was every day, he always seemed to be looking at us like, yo, everything is good. And. But we never really talked. We just always like, we always just exchanged whistles to him. You'd be like, let's go. I got you. What are they? Let's go. That was like our whole relationship. But then he approached me one day. But he would always look at me. And then he approached me one day and he asked me if I could help him out with something. He needed his family couldn't help him the next day. And he asked me if I could help him. And I didn't, there was no one that I was with in the desert. I went there all by myself. So I said, yes. And then I remember the next morning, he came to my doorstep. He was really early. It was 5.30 a.m. And I don't know if any of you have been to the desert or lived in the desert, but it gets bright really, really early in the desert. And when we lived in Burago, it was in the middle of the Anza Burago desert, which is the northeast end of San Diego County. It's an amazing, amazing place. It's sand everywhere, beautiful, octetio cactus. And he pulled up to my house that morning. And I still remember it. I looked out the window and he rolled up and there was this cloud of dust. And he was standing there like the Tasmanian devil. And he was holding two cups of Nescafe coffee. And he was just there. And he had this red pickup truck. And I was like, and he looked at me. He's like, Listo. And I said, all right, yeah, Listo, Listo. And then got in the truck and we headed east. And we headed east through the desert, through an area called Fonts Point, which is like a canyon that was a bunch of dry lakes. And we headed towards the Salten Sea, towards Coachella. And we went around and under the south bend of the Salten Sea and cut across to this town called Mecca, which is on the eastern end of the Salten Sea. Where a lot of farms are a lot of migrant workers, a lot of immigrants that come directly from Tijuana and Mexicali. And this is kind of their first stop for many of them. And we followed this road down and there was this crooked sign that said, cheapo. And a bunch of goats were just kind of prancing in the field. There's a bunch of dudes there and Salvador got out. The crazy thing about Latino culture sometimes that I see is that even if you don't know each other, you seem like you know each other. And I don't know, it's obviously the language, but I think there's a common and shared experience, especially in America, where a lot of almost everyone had to come through the country in the same way and in the same experience. So there's this silent understanding. And then the language itself lends itself to move itself away from any type of foreplay and go right into it and just be like, yo, what's up? So he was talking to the guy and then they made the exchange and they put the goat in the back. And it was a beautiful little goat. I remember it was a white coat with little spots of brown and beautiful small head and small little horns. And I had no idea what the heck we were doing. I was just going off with a ride drinking a free cup of coffee, you know? And I was very naive. I didn't really think about what was going on. I thought we were picking up a pet, to be honest. And so then we put the goat back and we drove back to Burrego, back through the desert. And we went to his house and he let the goat out. And again, I'm thinking everything's okay. But then there's that moment where you start to see clues. And then as we walked into his backyard, I looked to my left and I saw a table. A small little table with knives on it. And then I saw a rope hanging from a hangman's kind of noose. And then I saw him go over and start to fill a bottle, a corona bottle, empty corona bottles with water and salt. And again, we didn't really talk. We're just chilling. But just still really early. It's by this time it's only like 9.30, 10 o'clock. The sun is really hot. And he looks at me again and he asks me again, listo. And I said, yeah, I'm ready. And then we started running after the goat. And it was like rocky with the chicken. And then we were running after it. I remember the solver went from the left. I went for the ride. We couldn't catch him. And then all of a sudden I felt something. And he solver came from up in the clouds, like the lucha libre and jumped right onto the goat and got him in a headlock. And then he started yelling at me. La potéa de agua, he saw it. La potéa. And then he told me to get the bottles. And then I gave him the bottles. And then he just took the goat and started feeding water, the solution to the goat. And it looked really, really beautiful for a moment. And then once the goat drank all the salted water, he pulled the goat over. And at that moment I started to see things change very rapidly. I had cooked at this point for a while and I'd butchered a lot of meat. But I'd never killed an animal before. And he was just so natural about it. He wrapped the rope around the hind legs, pulled the goat up. The goats, horns were maybe a centimeter above the dirt. And I remember that goat. I remember it every day of my life now. Right at that moment that goat was looking straight at me in the eye. I don't know if it was really looking at me or if it was my imagination or that feeling when you have one, like you think that every baby is looking at you, recognizes you. But I remember that moment, those eyes were staring straight at me. And almost crying out to me to like, say, yo, man, what the fuck, dude? You know, like, fucking hell be, man. And those eyes were huge like the sun. And then right at that moment when the eyes opened, Salvador came up with a knife and slit that neck. And then the goat's neck snapped back in the blood fell from the neck. And then he went right to work on the belly and split the hide, opened it up, pulled out the guts. And he looked at me and he reminded me about the bottle. And he was teaching me. He was teaching me what was going on. And he explained to me that that solution didn't make the gut, when you cut the belly open that the guts wouldn't smell. And I realized that there was no smell. And so we went to work from there. He showed me how to pull the hide off. We moved it over to the table, broke it down into primals and subprimals, packed it up and wrapped it. We had the music going. We were playing, you know, at that time, this was the late 90s. So we were playing music from Wantsubastian. And a group of limit day was in Bandarroco, though. And all that music was going on. And the sun was creeping up. And we were packing it, wrapping it in Ziploc in plastic wrap, putting it in a glues and ice. Took a moment, had a cigarette, and a beer. And it was like 11 o'clock. And then we jumped in the car, put everything in. And then we went down to Mexicali. We drove about, it's about an hour south. You can find some of the best Chinese food in the world there, which you may not know, but you can. And we went into town. And went to his mom's restaurant. And we went through a screen door. And there were a bunch of ladies in there. And I feeling when you made the feel like you're late, when you weren't even late, especially when mothers do that to you. Like, what you did? But there was no time you were supposed to arrive in the first place. So they were there. And they were like, oh, all of a sudden, when you arrived, then all of a sudden, it's like, oh my god, you wasted my whole day. And now I can get to work. But they were already cutting the cilantro and the onions and the garlic. And they brought the goat. And she brought me over. And I have this weird connection also with mothers and grandmothers, where when I walk in, they pull me over always. And then they want me to cook with them. It's really weird. And so she showed me how to make media, basically. And they were wearing flower aprons. And all the knives were really worn. And there were wrinkles on their faces. And they were tasting with their thumbs and their fingers. And I sat down and then helped them. And they fed me the most wonderful bowl of goat stew in my life. And then we got back into truck. And then we headed back over the border. Across the border, different men. I felt like I knew everything about cooking when I went to that town, the small town. I kind of looked down on them in a way. Like I was this crazy chef, amazing young chef from New York City. I was going to show this desert town, like how to cook. But I came back to different men. And we went back to work. And about a month later, Salvador called me again and asked me if I was ready. And I told him, I feel an ambulance."

106,fromboyhoodtofatherhood.wav," My story is about a number of jobs that sort of shaped my life and shaped my whole destiny. And it was a couple of jobs I had during the ages of 20 to 21. So the story begins and yes, I was employed back then. OK, I don't know why you laughed, but I'll accept that. It's a good sign. OK, thinking out loud here. All right, so in 1984, I was a sophomore at Princeton. You can laugh at that, if you like. All right, so in 1984, I was a sophomore at Princeton. I wanted to take a year off because I had a very bad reputation at school. I was drinking a lot, getting in a lot of trouble. So I wanted to take a year off. Also, I had joined the Army to pay for Princeton. And I was looking at four years of active duty after school and eight years of reserve duty. So this was my last chance at freedom was after taking this year off from school. Later, just for the Harper's crowd, I did become a conscientious objector. And so I got out of the military. And avoided the Gulf War unlike my fellow ROTC guys, which is a good thing. All right, so but this was before I knew I was getting out of the Army, this was going to be my year of freedom. I needed to make money though during this year off. And a friend of mine, I know it's going to seem absurd, suggested that I be a model. And he took some pictures of me. I know I have rings under my eyes that go all the way to the back of my skull and I have no hair. But at 20, he had in his mind that I should be a model. So he takes some pictures of me. And I thought I was ugly, but I was vain enough to try it. I don't know what I was thinking. So I go, I look up in the Princeton library that I'm in a hand in phone book and I look up modeling. And I choose a modeling agency. And I go into New York with these pictures. This fellow takes him. He says, can I hold these overnight? I said yes. And the next morning calls me. Come into New York. We want to sign you to a contract. He had sent my pictures to the photographer Bruce Weber who does the Abercambrian Fritch and Vanity Fair, however you say Abercambrian, whatever. And that this fellow wanted a photograph. So suddenly with this small agency, which existed for about a year, and then there was a scandal with young female models from Minnesota closed down. But so suddenly I'm a model and I'm going off to this Bruce Weber photo shoot. And I remember we met early in the morning, a bunch of us had a bunch of male models in a van. And as we're going off to the Hamptons for this photo shoot, it was like 6 a.m. this one guy looks around, he's from Texas, he goes, hey, we're all blonde. You know, it just had dawn on him sort of. It was kind of interesting. And so we get out to the Hamptons and we're at this farmhouse. And it was like a scene out of Christopher Isher with the Berlin stories. All these blonde boys about 10 of us running around doing pushups so that our muscles would swell and in and out of the pool and a big buffet and everything waiting for the light to change. And so I get my picture taken by Bruce Weber, wonderful guy, very talented obviously. And he wanted me to drop my shorts and I felt embarrassed. I didn't think I could do that. And so anyways, I hid everything. I wasn't able to expose myself. So anyways, he took these pictures of me and I have one and I'm going to pass it out as a sort of gift for you. I only have 150 of them. So if you're one per table. But this is the Bruce Weber picture of me. And I was, anyway, the physique was looking good then. And you could see I had hair. It's sort of depressing to look at that. Now I don't know what happened. Anyway, so I ended up in the Whitney Biennial. I like to say to my artist friends, I've been in the Biennial but it was in this picture. And on the back of this is the thing from my nursery school, just so you can study that if you like. So pass that around. So maybe one per table since it's only 150. But so it could get to the back. All right, so here I am a model. I got several jobs. And at that photo shoot at Bruce Weber's farmhouse, I met a very pretty girl. She was his assistant and she gave me her phone number. So about a week later, I'm doing my modeling appointments, which are called Go Cs, which was made very simple for the models. It was Go C someone. And so this is what they call the appointments, where Go Cs. So I'm on a day of Go Cs. And I found myself in the West Village and right by Cornelia Street. And I remember that that girl lived on Cornelia Street. And my high school love was a girl named Cornelia. And so suddenly it was all fusing in my mind. So I call her and I get her roommate. And I explain that I'm in the neighborhood. And I won't say her name. Well, I'll say her name because I can't think of a new one. I said, is Aaron home? No. And I'm her roommate. And I said, oh, I'm right in the neighborhood. She said, well, if you want to come up and wait for her, it was late in the afternoon. She should be home soon. I go, OK. So I go up to her apartment. And I meet the roommate who was about 30 years old and very beautiful. And very exotic to me. I was 20. She was 30. And she offers me a glass of wine. We end up drinking two bottles of wine. Not only has my life been shaped by jobs, but also by liquor and sex, which should appeal to the Glenn Fidditch people. So we drink some wine. We drink like two bottles of wine. The first girl never comes home. And I end up making love to the roommate, which these things happen back then. And so we're making love. And she was older. And this was all very intriguing to me. And at a penultimate moment, the moment before an ultimate moment, I said to her, I said, can I have an ultimate moment? I, because I wasn't using a condom. And this was sort of before the whole condom hysteria and AIDS hysteria. And so everything was more about birth control, not, you know, I thought of a bad line earlier, death control. So this was all about birth control. And so I said, can I have an ultimate moment? And she said, of course you can. In a very sort of condescending way, which was a bad thing to hear right at a penultimate moment, because I don't know. It destroyed my confidence. It says a young lover. Oh, of course you can. Why didn't I know that? And so it wrecked my ultimate moment a little. Some short circuit had happened, but it happened. And so I thought I learned a valuable lesson, which is you never ask a woman if you can have your ultimate moment. You just go ahead and have it. You don't ask her unless she tells you beforehand that, you know, you need to be careful or something. So I thought this was the valuable lesson I learned to be a lothario. Never ask. So I go off to Europe to be a model, because I've done very well. I ended up being photographed by this guy named Horst. And I was in bus stop ads all over New York and Fernando Sanchez, lingerie and a pair of bikinis or something. So I go off to Europe to Milan to be a model, but I travel for about a month and a half, and I get in a terrible bar fight in Paris, France. And I get my nose broken and my lips split and my skull need and everything got really beat up. And I was supposed to report to Milan, Milan, whatever, five days later, but my nose was all purple. And I thought, you know what? I wanted to be a writer. I thought a writer shouldn't be a model. So I'm not going to go to Milan, and that's not a dignified job. So I became a male opair in Paris in the Montparnasse neighborhood. But that was kind of a good job, because I was right near where a Hemingway would hang out and even pass through the bakery that he used to pass through to get to Gertrude Stein. And so I had my two little charges. I think they were like six and three, and it was wonderful. And I was the only opair gossal in the whole quarter. So I was with all these Swedish and German girls, and it was even better than being a model and going to Cornelia Street. So I did that for five or so blissful months. And then I come back to the States, and it's late spring, and I go visit some friends at Princeton. And yet again, I get completely drunk. And in the next morning, I'm lying on the floor of my friend's dorm room, and I'm totally drunk and destroyed and debauched. And I'm lying on the hard floor, and the school newspaper comes flying underneath the door. There was like a bit of an inch. Comes flying under the door and opens up to a page to the classifies as it sort of wafted across the room. And it was right in front of me. And I looked down, and there was an advertisement saying, come spend the summer in New Hampshire at Camp Thoreau on an idyllic lake. And I thought, this is what I need. I need to stop drinking. I'm only 21, but I'm already want to stop drinking. I'm sorry, I couldn't finish people. And let me go off to New Hampshire to camp Thoreau. That's what I need to do. So I go off to Camp Thoreau. And I got the job because I'd been an opair, so I knew how to deal with children. I'd been a camp counselor during the summers in New Jersey at a day camp. So I get the job. I go off to Camp Thoreau. And I'm doing pretty well. And then a friend of mine sends me Lolita, which I had never read before, which was not the best sort of reading material when there was like 12 and 13 year old girls running around and completely distracted me in the wrong way. And so one night I got very drunk, as always, and ate some food. And the whole next day I was hung over the whole day. I had a terrible headache into the night. And I was sort of walking around the camp, you know, trying to clear my head of this headache that had lasted all day. And I see a light on at the art counselor's cabin. And so I go to see her, and she was 34. And I said, do you have an aspirin? And she gets me an aspirin. And I had admired her down by the lake, because I noticed that you could see some pubis sticking out from the sides. And I thought this was a more appropriate target for my affections than these young girls and the nabokov influence. So she gets me an aspirin, and we're sort of chatting. And right in that moment, a bat flies right between us. And we both scream out in the woods there in New Hampshire. And I say, well, maybe if we, and it's flying around, I said, maybe if we turn the lights off, I think bats are, bats are blind. But if we turn the lights off, it'll see. I don't know what my reason it was. So I turn the lights off, and we wait. I turn the lights back on. No bat. I felt very much, you know, oh, I really am a woodsman of very much a camp, the row, fellow. And right in that moment of hubris, as always, the bat flies right between us. Like some sort of mad cupid goes right between us. And I turn the lights off. Again, I put my arm around her. And one touch leads to another, I think, Blake had a poem about that. So anyway, we end up in bed. And I remember the rule that I had learned the year before with another older woman. Do not ask if you can have an ultimate moment. Just go ahead. And when you're ready, have your ultimate moment, you know, appropriately, perhaps after she may have had one. But I don't know if I knew that at 21. So I had two ultimate moments that night. It was quite lovely. And but the next day, it turned out I was terribly ill. And I ended up having some in neleb poisoning because I'd been drinking the night before and some bar and ate something off the floor. Who knows what? But so I had some in neleb poisoning. Ended up in Dartmouth Hospital. And the camp year came to an end. I never made love with the art counselor again. But we parted amicably. It was very sweet. And I go back to Princeton, become a conscientious objector. I just, I saw a novel after senior year. I moved to New York to work on this novel. And I get a letter from far away in the United States. And I open it up. And it turns out it's a letter from the art counselor. And with the letter is a picture of a 15 month old baby boy with red hair and blue eyes. And I'm told that it's my son. And nine months of pregnancy, 15 months of his life was exactly two years ago. And I was like, oh my god. And it looked exactly like I did. So sure enough, this moment that had begun on Cornelia Street. And of course you can. And then, you know, and then being an opair and getting a camp job and all this drinking had led to me looking at a child. I was 23 now. And so I went to where they lived. And I became his dad. And it turned out, you know, all this opair and counseling had been wonderful training. And I don't mean to be sentimental, but that's why we have the word because sometimes it happens. So I became his dad. And I have to say it's the best job I've ever had. And my son is now 17. He comes up in two days to be with me for 10 days. And I see him about every eight weeks. And he's a beautiful boy. And we've had an incredible father-son thing for 15 years now. So that's my story. And it all began with these jobs and somehow ended up there rather beautifully. So I'll do a hairy call."
107,findingmyownrescuer.wav," I'm alive. That's what Adam kept whispering as he waited for the ambulance. At 16, he was trapped in a mingled minivan. His spine twisted at the 7th thoracic vertebrae. He was in so much pain he knew he couldn't be dead. I'm alive. He repeated, both to stay that way and to count his blessings. I met him 24 years later when we were both in our 40s. By then, he was zipping around in a sporty wheelchair. When I asked him how he had become a paraplegic, he told me about the accident. His friend driving sober but going too fast. About his weeks in the hospital and months in rehab. About the agonizing surgery to fuse his spine. And then counseling where he was encouraged to mourn his old life and accept his new one. An incomplete paraplegic. He still has some feeling and motion below his injury. Meaning yes, he could have sex. Which was good to know. After we started seeing each other, that was the first question my friends asked. I was crazy about Adam. I told him everything about my life. My abusive father, complicated mother, failed relationships, professional crises and successes. He told me of his post-college depression. Of working in gang intervention programs and litigation. Of his relationships with women. Which had been good, but complicated. I had decided that however good the sex was or wasn't, we would be okay. But when we crossed that threshold, it was better than either of us had imagined it could be. A year later, we got engaged and bought an neglected but beautiful house. Three blocks from the Rahoboth Beach Delaware boardwalk. I imagined having sex in the private outdoor shower in our vintage bed with lemony sheets. We moved in and for two weeks, despite the exhaustion of unpacking, we floated on a cloud of love and new beginnings. Then something changed and we stopped having sex completely. Here's the thing about Adam and me. Despite all appearances with him being disabled, I actually consider myself to be the less able person in the relationship. People may assume that Adam is dependent on me, but I think it's the other way around. He's the stronger one and I rely more on him. At first, it seemed like he could do almost everything on his own, balancing against his Subaru and tossing the wheelchair into the hatchback, then maneuvering in and driving off using hand controls. In the morning, he would walk the dogs while I slept. He handled most of the grocery shopping and cooking and he had his emotional house in order. As for me, although I like to joke about my crazy childhood, in school until three, a screaming mother until evening and an abusive father into the night, it was no laughing matter. I'm okay now, but for a long time, I wasn't. After two failed marriages, decades of messes, and finally self forgiveness, I was still trying to extricate myself from that emotional seller when I met Adam. Before him, I had never felt love, security, and happiness with a good man I adored. That's why people who think Adam would be lost without me have it backward. After his world fell apart at 16, he rebuilt it, year after year, and now he is a fortress. My world was also blasted apart when I was a child, but I'm just getting a handle on it now. In many ways, it's as if I'm trying to escape from a crushed minivan of my own, and having to remind myself just as he once did, that I'm okay, that I'm alive. In my one story cottage, Adam's using a wheelchair didn't affect us much, but in the house we had bought, the entrance ramp wasn't finished, and it had three floors. So until it was fixed up, he had to depend on me to get him in, out, and around. In addition to my full-time work, I was the one now running the errands and walking the dogs. I was the one hauling moldy beach umbrellas, warped books, and broken coolers to the growing pile of trash in the backyard. To get those ramps and grab bars installed, I was also the one supervising carpenters, painters, and stone masons. One evening after the contractors left, Adam trying to help, picked up a heavy box of discarded bathroom tiles and other trash, and headed for the pile outside. As he rolled toward our mudroom, the box slipped off his lap, sending dozens of filthy tiles crashing to the floor, along with someone's leftover big gulp cup, which splashed soda over freshly painted walls. I didn't know whether to scream, cry, or run away. Instead, I said, leave me alone, I don't need your help. Adam disappeared, and I cleaned up alone, crying. I can't do this. I whispered as I swept and scrubbed, not this house or this man. Afterward, two worked up to sleep. I leashed Fred, my dog from pre-Adam days, and headed into the night. Soon I stood at my old cottage, just blocks away. I admired the striped curtains in the window. Inside, I could see my gorgeous old bookcase, which I had carted with me through six moves, having to finally abandon it because it didn't fit the airy coastal cottage feeling we wanted. Now, I missed it, and Fred was staring with longing, I thought, that his former backyard. Do you wish we were still here? Just us, I asked. I thought of the time he drove for two hours, so I could run into stores to find the caramel's my grandmother likes for her birthday, of how he stocks ice cream sandwiches for me, and quits the dogs every morning when he rises with them so I can sleep. I felt overcome with love for him. How could I have been so awful earlier? Back home, he was asleep in our bed. I crawled quietly into my side, feeling love for him, but still not wanting to touch. I hated the distance between us, but I couldn't overcome it. Sex had always been a positive and passionate thing for us. Now I not only didn't want to have sex, I also couldn't even get close. One night I went online and looked up spinal cord injuries and premature death. Then, I read for hours confirming what I had always suspected, but hadn't contemplated. How susceptible he is to blood clots, infections, and gangrene. The summer before, Adam had fallen asleep on a heating pad, never feeling it cooking his skin. The burn took months to heal, leaving a postcard-sized scar. It made me crazy with fear. I can't take it if you die from something we could have controlled. I told him. He kissed my head. We don't control anything. I snapped at him to stop the Zen stuff. Reading online that night, I knew I was right. His injury had devastated him long ago, and he had recovered. He was strong, but he was not as strong as I needed him to be. He was not strong enough to keep me from losing him. We went about our days fixing up the house. We bought a couch and cushions for a rocker. From a vintage fabric book, I chose a pattern to re-opulster an armchair. Faded roses on faded blue. I loved it. Adam hated it. I knew he would. This is what I do if you died. I said, tapping the fabric sample, feeling the tears coming. I would do the whole house and faded flowers and turn it into a home for troubled ladies. I would like to help people. I don't think I could go on without you. Would there be a portrait of me over the fireplace? He asked. I laughed. You'd find love again, he said. Or you'd have a home for ladies. Or both. I'm terrified of losing you. I finally said. And sometimes I hate you for it. He nodded as if he had been waiting for me to figure that out all along. Okay, he said. But I'm not going anywhere. At least not this week. I had a yard full of trash, a house in disarray, and a prince charming in a wheelchair. But he was my love. And this was my life. And that night we pulled our bodies close, hoping to press ourselves together for as long as we both shall live."
108,thumbsup.wav," So it's the middle 90s and a peace treaty gets signed between Israel and Jordan. And if you're already wondering what that has to do with a Jewish boy from Long Island, I've been spending an enormous amount of time in Israel and it really feels like a second home at this point and I've completely co-opted their culture. And yes, everyone's excited about peace, but there's a second part which is Jordan contains the ancient Nabatean city of Petra. And this is a huge part of Israeli culture and there are legends and there are dreams everyone just wants to see that ancient red rock. They want to see that desert city. I mean, there are songs about it, folks songs about it, there's just endless things connected to it and my favorite part is, you know, every few years a couple of kids will literally like sneak across the border like crawl through a minefield, make their way to the desert just to see that city and then be caught by Jordanian authorities and return as like hailed as idiotic heroes that everybody just, you know, dreams of doing the same thing. Well now you can cross the border, you can go and see Petra and that is a pretty exciting dream for me. The other thing is at this point in time I am a super serious photographer and you're all invited over after to see my slideshow. But I'm, you know, I'm doing studio work, I'm all dead serious but I'm also, you know, traveling and I've got my, you know, I've got my pyramids and my acropolis and my eye full tower and my London bridge and man, do I want Petra like through my viewfinder. I want those pictures so bad. The complicating and mitigating factor is that I am cowardly. I was, you know, we call my mother the danger police, I'm terrified of everything. I don't want to cross that but like what if something happens, you know, what the piece goes bad? Like do we need to be the first Jews like rushing over being allowed, you know, in Aman. It's, you know, it's, it's really not what I'm going to do and that's when my friend Mike calls and Mike and I we really get along perfectly because if we were even 10 years younger, Mike would be so medicated into submission. You'd have like, you know, literally like a riddle in drip. He would just be like comatose and quiet and really well behaved. But what he is is brilliant and energetic and a ton of fun and really convincing with me and he's like, I know it's your dream, it's my dream like let's do it. We can get there. Let's get tickets, you know, so we're like, I'm on it. So I grab one pair of skis, these toothbrush floss gum care. Anyway, but I also take my 90 pound bag of camera equipment. I got my FM two and my pistol grip and my, you know, fisheye lens and my telephoto and also young ends. There's something, you know what's inside a camera at that point? What's inside an FM two? Nothing. There's a mirror that flips up and then there's film. You put film in the back. So I've got X-ray bags because I'm again an artist and I don't want like the flight to alter my images. Anyway, but I'm like, I've got my high speed and my grainy and I've got like 10 million pounds of film and we get on that plane and change about 96 more times and we hit Jerusalem and we make camp and then we get on a whole bus full of Jews and we cross the Allen B. Bridge and the Jordan River and it is not only biblical, it's like modern moving. Like there is peace, that is a great and exciting thing and I'm having a great time, you know, with Mike in Amman in Jarash and he's the kind of guy like he behaves himself but it's always like, you know, he gets me there but then I'm like, why are you touching that? Why are you over there? Do you see anyone else on the other side of that red velvet rope? Then you probably should, you know, back here. But you know what I'm saying? We're doing fine and we get into the desert and we get to Petra and Petra is not there. What is there are two giant stone cliffs like two mighty cliffs where the crack in between there is a small path and you are just transported through time. You know, like you just think what it must be to cross through the desert to not know if you're going to live and die where you're going to get water and to enter this crack between these like two mighty cliffs and walk and walk and then it opens up and there is this stunning city and if I haven't made it clear, it is not built Petra, it is not constructed, it is carved in the reverse Mount Rushmore style like from the tip of your nose on back in the mountains. This is not with digital imaging you'd faint at the beauty of it but this notion that they did in like 300 BC, I just can't get over. It is more stunning than I imagine. I'm taking my pictures and there are the pillars and the treasury and the statuary and the temples and but what I care about what I'm most obsessed with is the geometry. There are these triangles. I mean perfect triangles ornate cut in the reverse and that is what really those are the main pictures. That is what I'm getting at the end. I've like found my subject and I get my photos and it is honestly a dream come true. Mike has broken nothing. He is on our way back to the bus and someone is the desert. Someone has parked a donkey next to the bus, same lot. I'm saying and then Mike needs his silly photo. That is my art photo, silly photo. Mike needs, I got my triangle and then I, here is Mike and he is doing it especially silly pose and I know this is a great moment for him and I zoom in and I focus and for a New Yorker this is a different wonder of the world. I'm like it is a silly pose with a five like a donkey and then I understand it is like that is not a leg. This donkey is super excited to see us. It is a fully erect donkey and this is my triangle. This is Mike's moment. I get the photo for him. Nobody is hurt. Donkeys not touched. Nobby's reality. We are good. We get on the bus. We drive back across that bridge. Back into Israel. It really feels like coming home for me. We have had this great trip and back to like feeling Jewish in a Muslim country and feeling like this Israel Jordan thing. We are so high on cross cultural understanding and the emotion of it and the religious love where like let's go get our Christianity on. We head straight for the old city and we head straight for the church of the Holy Sepulchre and I will give you a little tour but before you go in the church of the Holy Sepulchre to the left there is a guy sitting on the chair and this guy is a Muslim guy and he has a key. Why does he have a key? Because his father has a key and his father is father and father is father and father is father. It goes back forever. He has the key because you sort of understand the region. Nobody gets along. Everyone gets along. What is the problem? The problem with peace is Jews don't get along with Jews. Muslims don't get along with Christians. They are maybe six factions that share the church and the Franciscans don't get along with the Latin patriarch and the Greek Orthodox don't get along with the Ethiopian church. And for that reason this guy sits there. He unlocks the church for the Christians every day and that key is 500 years old and it's 500 years old because the 800 year old key broke. That's how long his family has been sitting there and then over the door there is a ladder because someone was going to fix something or move something or clean an officer get up there but then again the fight breaks out. It's my let you can't go up it but I can come down it. That immovable ladder has been sitting there for 300 years. That's the church. I want to go in but of course Mike, you know, he's wild and crazed and energetic. He's also super charming. He's with a whole bunch of priests right by the door. They're all smiling and laughing and we need a Mike photo right before we go in there and he gets them all around him. Everyone's crowd around smiling. Mike in the middle and he gives the old Fonsi thumbs up. A big happy hey thumbs up. Everybody smiling. I get the photo. We step out of Jerusalem's son into the darkness and the dust mites and all this guilt but sort of ancient beauty. It's extraordinary. And there is like a six foot marble slab. This is where they washed Christ's body before in this same place he was entombed and from where Christ rose. You know what I'm saying? Like I am standing at this marble slab where his body was washed and for me who likes to live through a camera lens. I put my camera down and everybody else is filming. I'm not even sure if I'm sitting here or filled with tourists but I am having a quiet, transcendent moment. It is big for me. And that's when I get hit in the back of the head. And I get hit again and I'm getting grabbed and I'm sort of getting you know beaten around the head and neck and I'm saying I look over and it is an ancient priest who is beating me with a whole bunch of backup priests. You know I don't know what's going to go on if it's going to be a pile on but he's getting out. Because I have to say one huge point for Christianity like literally how many rabbis over time wanted to give me a good zez and beat some sense into me. And it is a first beating delivered by a priest. So good for you church. Anyway but I'm being dragged outside. All those video cameras now they got action more than a marble slab. Everyone's filming me. I look over. Mike's being dragged out but I'm getting like the brunt of it and I can't stand what's going, I can't figure out what's going on. And the first thing that I figure out is the reason he gets to give the beating is this old priest is he's not just in charge of these priests. He's in charge of all the priests. He's in charge of the church. He's in charge of all the Christians of Palestine and Israel. This is basically the Pope of Jerusalem. This is the most holy man in town and he's furious at me. I've got that part down. And then I saw this out the second bit which is relevant which is we've had a little cultural misunderstanding. You see Mike's thumbs up where this guy's from that is literally raising the middle finger. You know what I'm saying? So basically we thought hey thumbs up for Jesus and what he's done is given a middle finger to all that is holy and good and Jesus like in the most holy place on earth. So I'm trying to like get things better because again I am now terrified. I mean this is the guy who can pick up and call the prime minister of Israel. He can call my president like for those of you who don't know current events or have never heard of history at all things in Jerusalem blow up so easy. You know what I'm saying? Like this can go big and bad and by the way back to nightly news. I'm like we're not Mike. We're not going to be on local night. We're going to be like global possibly and they've got about 17 camera angles. They can make a nice real of us being beaten and dragged out like everyone is following the tourists are coming to film this. Anyway I'm just saying like Fanzi a hit your ride. Happy times. I'm trying to explain this something but it will not go away and I am terrified and you know Mike's trying to keep me calm that's always his job and then it gets bigger and then I understand he's not just mad at me. This guy's mad at my camera. It's not just the motion. It's I took a picture of it. So easy as pie there I give us the film. There's one problem. I'm a coward on every front but when it comes to the arts I'll do anything. Those are my petro photos. You know I'm saying you can't have him and I won't give up the photos and I don't think I've ever seen Mike look scared but he's like just give them but I'm not giving the picture and this is maybe the only point me and the very angry piece of priests agree on because I'm like I am not leaving here without that film and they're like no you're literally not leaving here without that film. Like we are surrounded. We are put up against the wall and sat down and it is getting anger and more upsetting and there is no understanding happening between us at all and somebody sends for a Jewish policeman to get over here and he listens and he's listening and I'm not giving up the film and they're not letting us go and it is actually an incident is taking place which is my worst nightmare and then the cop you know like he's done his cop training he's like we have evidence. You know why not just give me the film we'll develop that we'll let's look at the photo in question. So he sends off it's back to the film time the world of film at the time where everyone has film about every eight feet is a photo mat. So even in the old city in Jerusalem you can buy your worry beads and your you know your sheep gloves and all that but there's got photo mats so they bring back the Muslim photo mat guy and he's like I'm on the case so I was like I trust this guy he looks like a good man I wrote up my film and I was like fine let's let's do this let's judge let's see because you know what I'm sitting there and I'm surrounded and I'm terrified but like the tiniest trickle of confidence is starting to come in and I'm looking at that ladder and I'm thinking we're in trouble after two minutes here but you guys have been here for two thousand years not getting along like what happened to my theology this is the complete Christian theology by me turn the other cheek that's the only thing I know but I'm like what about like turn the other cheek what about believing we are good people like he's a good guy like can't you see like why not give the benefit of the doubt that we're not only help this church and this city and this region it would help everybody in the world you know what I'm saying and I'm getting all positive and feeling almost righteous and then the donkey oh the donkey the photo before that photo well we all know what that is and I'm thinking we are bad boys we are very very bad and we deserve what we're getting and I hope under the church is a church prison for us because we should really do our time so now I'm in a terror and forget one hour photo I mean this guy's rushing but it is ten lifetimes for me dying there you know waiting terrified and God bless photomat guy that's why I'm here tonight to tell you God bless photomat guy he could have done whatever he wanted he's seen him all he brings back an envelope of negatives and he has made one single print he has printed the photo in question and he gives this to Pope of Jerusalem priest and he studies it with his other priest studying behind him and they look at us and he's studying this picture and you know what also God bless that guy because you know what that motion is one motion to him he doesn't have to see another motion he doesn't have to hear any sense and he doesn't have to believe that we have any good will at all but he looks at that photo and he sees his smiling priests and he sees a smiling mic and you know again don't know much of theology but like he forgives us we're absolved you know he pockets the photo I get back my precious negatives and like that like a cloud of black robes you know the priest move off into the dark and and and we're free to go and I just you know that moment is so big to me I think about it like with our Muslim photomat guy God bless him again and our Jewish policemen and a whole bunch of Christian priests we carved out a little corner of peace in Jerusalem and status quo was restored"
